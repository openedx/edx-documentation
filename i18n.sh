# This script purpose is to ease process needed to support i18n
# for the doc. It does that by first generating pot from the
# rst files of a  selected projects using sphinx to generate gettext
# (which outputs the pot files) and then the next step
# is to use sphinx-intl to write to the ./tx/config file, hence
# this script cerates the ./tx/config file. Note: if the file,
# already exists it will be overwritten!.
# This script assumes sphinx-intl is already installed as well,
# It can be installed by `pip install sphinx-intl`
# For more information, about sphinx-intl please visit:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html
