The list of posts on the **Discussion** page provides visual cues to help you
distinguish posts that are new, or that have responses or comments that you have
not read yet, from exchanges that you have already read completely.

==================
Sort by Activity
==================

Color-coded callout images appear when you sort the list of posts **by recent
activity** or **by most activity**. This is the default view when you open the
**Discussion** page.

* A **gray callout image on a gray background** indicates that you have read the
  post and all of its responses and comments.

* A **white callout image on a gray background** indicates that you have read the
  original post, but the post has new responses or comments that you have not
  read yet.

* A **blue callout image on a white background** indicates that you have not yet
  read the post.

        and callout images

The number in each callout image indicates the total number of contributions in
the exchange (the post and its responses and comments). To see the number of
contributions that you haven't read yet, move your cursor over the callout
image.

==================
Sort by Votes
==================

You can also sort the list of posts by number of votes. To do this, click the
sorting list in the upper-right corner of the list of posts, and then click **by
most votes**.

If you sort by most votes, the number of votes that the post has received
appears in place of the callouts. For more information, see :ref:`Vote for Posts
or Responses`.
