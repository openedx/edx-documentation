Embedded Files and Calendars
####################################

Courses can include files, such as documents, spreadsheets, and presentations,
and a calendar. Your instructor uses Google to create and maintain these files
and calendars. They appear in the body of your course just like any other
course content.

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries. 
 If Google services are not available in your area, you might see an "image
 unavailable" message in the place of the Google file or calendar. Your
 instructor might provide alternative resources if Google services are not
 available for you.

***********************
Google Drive Files
***********************

Your course might include the following types of Google Drive files.

* Google Docs (text documents)
* Google Drawings (images)
* Google Forms (forms or surveys)
* Google Slides (presentations)
* Google Sheets (spreadsheets)

For example, your course might include a spreadsheet that resembles this one.

You can interact with these Google Drive files in your course. For example,
you can complete forms, look through the slides in a presentation, and enter
different values in a spreadsheet. However, you cannot save changes that you
make to the Google Drive file.

***********************
Google Calendars
***********************

If your course includes a Google calendar, you see that calendar in the body of
the course. You can also add it to your own Google calendar.

By default, the view that opens in the course calendar is the view that the
instructor set. You can change the view by clicking the **Week**, **Month**, or
**Agenda** tabs in the upper-right corner.

When you view the calendar in your course, the dates and times on the calendar
automatically adjust to your local time. Your time zone information appears in
the lower-left corner of the screen.

=====================================================
Add the Course Calendar to Your Own Calendar
=====================================================

If you have your own Google calendar, you can add the Google calendar from a
course to it. After you add a calendar, you see that calendar whenever you
view your personal calendar, even if you are not signed in to your edX
account. The course information appears together with your own information.

To add the course calendar to your own calendar, view the course calendar in the
course, and then click the **Google Calendar** icon in the lower-right corner of
the course calendar.
