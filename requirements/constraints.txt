# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# This is needed until https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/images/issues/40 is closed.
# The current latest version of sphinx-contrib-images is not compatible with Sphinx 8.0.0
# and doesn't have proper constraining so we need to hold back sphinx here until the above
# issue is closed.
