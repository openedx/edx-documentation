****************************
Overview
****************************

When you are designing a course in Studio, you can select **View Live** to
test your work work, find gaps and errors, and mimic the learner
experience. To gather information about the overall experience of taking a
course, you can also conduct a beta test of the course.

.. _Beta_Process:

******************************************
The Beta Testing Process
******************************************

During a beta test, you gather information about the experience of taking your
course in an effort to improve its quality. The phases of the beta testing
process, and some questions that you may find useful to consider as you prepare
for each phase, follow.

#. **Planning**: What are your objectives for the test? What is the schedule
   for testing?

#. **Recruitment**: How many testers do you need? How much time do you expect
   testers to spend? When do you need them to complete their feedback?

#. **Provide access to your course**: Can testers access your entire course
   immediately, or are its sections and subsections available at different
   times? How will that affect the schedule?

#. **Collect feedback**: How do you want testers to provide feedback? Who
   checks for feedback, and how often?

#. **Evaluate feedback**: How is feedback evaluated? Who decides what changes
   to make as a result, and on what schedule?

#. **Conclusion**: How do you acknowledge the efforts of your testers? What do
   you share with them about the results of their efforts?

There is no one answer to any of these questions. They are included here as
background on the role that beta testing can play in the preparation of your
course.

.. _Qualities_Testers:

***************************************
The Beta Testing Role 
***************************************

Beta testers have early access to the course. Beta testers are not members of
the course team: they do not have information about "how it is supposed
to work". They use their own computers and Internet connections to view
videos, follow links, and complete problems. They interact with the course as
learners will to find, and make, mistakes.

However, beta testers are not the same as other learners in the course,
either. They have privileged access to the course and have more time to review
and complete the course materials than the enrolled learners do. Course
discussions are not open before the course start date, so beta testers cannot
participate in community conversations. As a result of these differences, beta
testers do not receive certificates when they complete a course.

.. note:: If one of your beta testers wishes to earn a certificate for the 
 course, she must create a separate user account with a different username and
 email address. She can then use that separate, non-privileged user account to
 enroll in the course and repeat the work, completing assignments and exams
 when they are available to all students.

==================================
Qualities of Good Beta Testers
==================================

A beta test is valuable in part because it is unscripted. Your beta testers are
not following a predetermined series of steps, or using a particular computer
environment, when they access your course. When you recruit beta testers,
however, you may find these skills and characteristics to be helpful.

* Curiosity.

* Attention to detail for identifying problems and inconsistencies.

* Solid communication skills for reporting problems to the course team. 

Your beta testers should also have varying levels of knowledge about the course
content:

* To recognize when material is wrong or missing, at least one tester should
  know the content well.

* To identify material that is unclear, at least one tester should be less
  familiar with the content.

Depending on the objectives you set for your beta test, you might want to
consider recruiting testers who use assistive technologies, who have different
native languages, or who have varying levels of familiarity with computer
software.

=========================================
Using Course Team Members as Beta Testers 
=========================================

The course team can provide valuable feedback about your course. However, they
are typically stakeholders in the success of your course and have a significant
amount of knowledge about it. As a result, they can be too close to the course
to interact with it in the same way as learners will. They can also be either
reluctant to provide feedback, or overly zealous.

If you do want a team member to be a beta tester, note that the privileges of
the Staff or Admin role override those of a beta tester. The team member must
use a different, second email address to create an additional edX account and
enroll in the course, and the course team must assign only the beta tester role
to that edX account. The course team member experiences the course as a learner
only when she signs in to edX using the beta tester account.

.. _What_Test:

*********************************
What to Test
*********************************

Beta testers should interact with everything in the course. 

* Select all links.

* Watch all videos.

* Download video transcripts and other files.

* Complete all problems. 

Beta testers can use a desktop computer to access an edX website, the edX
mobile app on a smartphone, or both to complete their tests. As they work,
beta testers log issues and questions for the course team.

.. _How_Testers_See_Course:

******************************************
How Beta Testers See Course Content
******************************************

To beta test a course, you: 

* Define a number of days before section and subsection release days for
  testing to begin.

* Identify beta testers.

Designated beta testers see course content before students can. The matrix
that follows shows the course content that beta testers can access earlier
than other students.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 20 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - 
     - Yes
     - No
   * - Before the course enrollment date
     - X
     -
   * - Before the course start date
     - X
     -
   * - Before the section release day
     - X
     -
   * - Before the subsection release day
     - X
     -
   * - Before the unit is published
     - 
     - X
   * - Before a draft replaces a live unit
     - 
     - X

The course team can continue to add content in Studio after the beta test
begins. When new content is ready for testing, be sure to :ref:`publish the
unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. important:: When you set up the beta test and define when it starts, verify 
 that the first section, subsection, and unit in your course are available to
 be tested. If that first unit is not available, an error occurs when testers
 attempt to access any other content in the course.

================================
Define When the Beta Test Starts
================================

To define the start of the beta test, you use Studio to specify a number of
days before the release day that is defined for each section and subsection in
your course.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu select **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the field for the **Days Early for Beta Users** policy key, enter the
   number of days before each section and subsection release day for beta
   testers to have access.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

===========
Example
===========

.. Is this example helpful? how can we assess whether it is frightening/confusing to course team, or helpful?

Beta tester access to courseware for a course with **Days Early for Beta
Users** = 20 and 2 sections:


.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 40

   * - Course enrollment date = 31 August
     - 31 August; earlier if enrolled by course team
   * - Course start date = 15 September
     - 26 August
   * - Section 1 release day = 15 September
     - 26 August
   * - section 2 release day = 22 September
     - 2 September
   * - Subsection 1 release day = 22 September
     - 2 September
   * - Subsection 2 release day = 24 September
     - 4 September
   * - Subsection 2, unit 1 visibility = public
     - 4 September
   * - Subsection 2, unit 2 visibility = public; draft in progress
     - 4 September for public version; no access to draft
   * - Subsection 2, unit 3 visibility = private
     - No access

In this example, the beta testers cannot access all of the courseware when the
beta test starts on 26 August: they can access section 1 but not section 2. You
may want to provide a schedule of section availability to your testers so that
they can plan their time appropriately. Future release dates do not display to
the beta testers in the courseware.

.. _Add_Testers:

*********************************
Adding Beta Testers 
*********************************

Before you can add beta testers:

* You need the email address or username of each beta tester. 

* Each beta tester must register and activate a user account for that email
  address/username.

When you add beta testers, note the following. 

* If the beta test starts before the course **Enrollment Start Date**, testers
  cannot enroll themselves in your course. However, you can enroll the beta
  testers prior to the **Enrollment Start Date**.

* If you add the beta testers after the defined start of the beta test, and
  they are enrolled in the course, they see your course on their **Current
  Courses** dashboards when they log in.

* If you add beta testers before the test starts, or if they are not enrolled,
  they do not see your course on their dashboards. You can enroll the beta
  testers in the course yourself, and you may want to send an email message to
  remind them when the test begins.

.. _Add_Testers_Bulk:

================================
Add Multiple Beta Testers
================================

If you have a number of beta testers that you want to add, you can use the
"batch add" option to add them all at once, rather than individually. With this
feature, you have options to enroll the beta testers in the course (before or
after the **Enrollment Start Date**) and send an email message to notify the
beta testers that they have been added.

To add multiple beta testers:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Membership**. 

#. In the **Batch Beta Tester Addition** section of the page, enter one or more
   addresses or usernames separated by commas or line feeds (the Enter key).
   You can also copy data from a CSV file of email addresses and paste it here.
 
#. To enroll the beta testers in your course, leave **Auto Enroll** selected.
   If the beta test starts before the course **Enrollment Start Date**, testers
   cannot enroll themselves in your course.

#. To send an email message to the beta testers, leave **Notify users by
   email** selected. An example of the message that is sent to a beta tester
   who is not enrolled in the course follows.

   ::
      Dear betatester,

      You have been invited to be a beta tester for *course* at edge.edx.org
      by a member of the course team.

      Visit https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-name/about to join the course
      and begin the beta test.

#. Select **Add beta testers**.

To remove the Beta Tester role from one or more users, enter their email
addresses in the **Batch Add Beta Testers** field and then select **Remove beta
testers**. 

.. note:: The **Auto Enroll** option has no effect when you select **Remove 
 beta testers**. The user's role as a beta tester is removed; course
 enrollment is not affected.

================================
Add Beta Testers Individually
================================

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor** then **Membership**.

#. In the **Administration List Management** section, use the drop-down list to
   select **Beta Testers**.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email address
   or username and click **Add Beta Tester**. 

   If the beta test starts before the **Enrollment Start Date** of your course,
   you can also enroll the beta tester. See :ref:`Enrollment`.

To remove the Beta Tester role from users individually, find the user in the
list of beta testers, and then select **Revoke access** to the right of that
user's email address.

.. _Issue_Reporting_During_Course:

*********************************
Reporting Issues During a Course
*********************************

Despite the efforts of the course team and the beta testers, additional
problems, questions, and issues can occur while a course is running.

* Often, learners report issues by asking questions in a discussion. Your
  discussion moderation team can watch for posts that indicate problems.

* To let learners know the best way to report problems, you can post
  information on the **Course Info** page or post it in a discussion.
