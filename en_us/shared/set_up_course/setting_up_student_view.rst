Setting Details About Your Course
######################################################

This topic describes how to set details about your course in Studio. The
details you set determine the information that learners see about the course on
their dashboards and on the course **About** page. For more information,
see :ref:`SFD Dashboard Settings Profile`.

.. only:: Open_edX

  You configure these course details in Studio.

.. only:: Partners

  For courses running on edX Edge, you configure these course details in
  Studio. For courses running on edx.org, you work directly with your partner
  manager to configure some of these course details.

For information about setting important dates for the course, see
:ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

For information about setting the licensing for the course, see
:ref:`Licensing a Course`.

.. _The Learner Dashboard:

***********************************
The Learner Dashboard
***********************************

After a learner enrolls in a course, the course is listed on that learner's
dashboard. From the dashboard, a learner can open a course
that has started. If the course has not started, or has already ended, the
dashboard shows the start or end date.

 :alt: An image of two courses in the dashboard, with the start dates and
     times.

For more information, see :ref:`View Start and End Dates`.

.. _The Course About Page:

***********************************
The Course About Page
***********************************

The course **About** page, sometimes called the course summary page, provides
information about your course to learners. In addition to the course
:ref:`start and end dates<Scheduling Your Course>` and an overview of course
objectives, the **About** page can include information such as a course
description with course prerequisites, requirements, and team biographies.
Learners can see the **About** page before they enroll in the course, and
might decide to enroll based on the content of the page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/about_page.png
 :alt: An image of the course About page.
 :width: 600

.. only:: Open_edX

  If the CourseTalk widget is enabled for your instance of the Open edX
  platform, the **About** page for every course also includes the CourseTalk
  widget. Learners who have enrolled in your course use this widget to write
  reviews of your course on the **Home** page in the LMS. These reviews are
  then visible on the course **About** page. For more information, see
  :ref:`installation:Add CourseTalk`.

===========================================
Adding Information to the Course About Page
===========================================

.. only:: Open_edX

  You configure the contents of this page in Studio.

.. only:: Partners

  For courses running on edX Edge, you configure the contents of this page in
  Studio, as described in this topic. For courses running on edx.org, you work
  directly with your partner manager to configure the contents of this page.

.. _Describe Your Course:

Describe Your Course
*********************

Learners see the description of your course on the course **About** page. For
example, the course description is circled in the following course **About**
page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/about-page-course-description.png
 :alt: A course About page with the description circled.
 :width: 600

.. only:: Partners

  .. note:: For courses running on edx.org, you must communicate the course
   description to your edX partner manager to ensure that the information
   on the course **About** page is accurate.

Given the diversity of online learners, be sure to review your course
description to ensure that it clearly communicates the target audience, level,
and prerequisites for your course. Use concrete, unambiguous phrasing, such as
a prerequisite of "understand eigenvalue decomposition" rather than
"intermediate linear algebra".

To provide a description for your course, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Introducing Your Course** section, then locate the
   **Course Overview** field.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/course_overview.png
    :alt: Image of the HTML course description.
    :width: 600

#. Overwrite the content as needed for your course, following the directions in
   the boilerplate text. Do not edit HTML tags. For a template that includes
   these placeholders, see the :ref:`A Template For Course Overview`.

#. To test how the description will appear to learners, from the text that
   follows the **Course Overview** field select **your course summary page**.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

.. _Add a Course Image:

Add a Course Image
*********************

The course image that you add in Studio appears on the **About** page for the
course and on the learner dashboard. It must be a minimum of 378 pixels in
width by 225 pixels in height, and in .jpg or .png format. Make sure the image
that you upload maintains the aspect ratio of those dimensions so that the
image appears correctly on the dashboard.

An example of a course on the dashboard with a course image follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dashboard-course-image.png
 :alt: Image of the course image in the dashboard.
 :width: 600

To add a course image, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Course Image** section, select **Upload Course Image**, and then
   follow the prompts to find and upload your image. To specify an image that
   has already been :ref:`added to the course<Add Files to a Course>`, select
   **files & uploads**.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

#. View your dashboard to test how the image will appear to learners.

.. only:: Partners

  .. note::
    For courses running on edx.org, the course image that you add in Studio is
    used on the learner dashboard, but does not automatically appear on the
    course **About** page. Work directly with your edX partner manager to set
    up the **About** page assets and course image.

.. _Add a Course Video:

Adding a Course About Video
****************************

The course "about" video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll,
and reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

This video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or institution is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

This video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than 2 minutes.

Before you upload a course about video, make sure that it follows the same
:ref:`Compression Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as your
course content videos.

.. note::

  * If you upload both a course image and a course about video, the course
    image appears on learner dashboards with a **play** icon superimposed on
    it. If you upload only a course video, the first frame of the the video
    file appears with the **play** icon.

  * The process for adding a course about video is different than the process
    for including videos as part of the content of your course. For more
    information about including video content, see :ref:`Working with Video
    Components`.
