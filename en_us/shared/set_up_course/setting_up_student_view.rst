Setting Details About Your Course
######################################################

This topic describes how to set details about your course in Studio. The
details you set affect the information learners see about the course on their
dashboards. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Dashboard Settings Profile`.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

For information about setting important dates for the course, see
:ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

For information about setting the course license, see :ref:`Licensing a
Course`.

.. _The Course About Page:

***********************************
The Course About Page
***********************************

The following example shows the course About page. Learners can see the
About page before they enroll in the course, and may decide to enroll
based on the content of the page.

 :alt: An image of the course About page.
 :width: 600

You configure the contents of this page in Studio, as described in this topic.

.. note:: Given the diversity of MOOC learners, be careful to clearly
   communicate the target audience, level, and prerequisites for your course.
   Aim for concrete, unambiguous words. For example, your description of a
   course prerequisite might include ``understand eigenvalue decomposition``
   rather than ``intermediate linear algebra``).

.. _The Learner Dashboard:

***********************************
The Learner Dashboard
***********************************

After a learner enrolls in your course, the course is listed on that learner's
**Current Courses** dashboard with the course image. From the dashboard, a
learner can open a course that has started. If the course has not started, the
learner can see the start date, as explained in :ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dashboard-course-start-and-end.png

     times.

.. _Describe Your Course:

************************
Describe Your Course
************************

Learners see the description of your course on the course About page.

An example of a course description, titled "About this course", follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/about-page-course-description.png
 :alt: Image of a course summary with a description.
 :width: 600

.. note:: For courses on edX.org, you must communicate the course description
 to your edX partner manager, to ensure the content is accurate on the course
 About page.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Introducing Your Course** section, then locate the
   **Course Overview** field.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/course_overview.png
    :alt: Image of the HTML course description.
    :width: 600

#. Overwrite the content as needed for your course, following the directions in
   the boilerplate text. Do not edit HTML tags. For a template that includes
   placeholders, see :ref:`A Template For Course Overview`.

#. Select **your course summary page** in the text beneath the field to test
   how the description will appear to learners.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have completed the course
   description.

.. _Add a Course Image:

************************
Add a Course Image
************************

The course image that you add in Studio appears on the dashboard. It should be
a minimum of 378 pixels in width by 225 pixels in height, and in .jpg or .png
format. Make sure the image that you upload maintains the aspect ratio of those
dimensions so that the image appears correctly on the dashboard.

An example of a course on the dashboard with a course image follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dashboard-course-image.png
 :alt: Image of the course image in the dashboard.
 :width: 600

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Course Image** section.

#. To select an image from your computer, click **Upload Course Image**, then
   follow the prompts to find and upload your image.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have added the course image.

#. View your dashboard to test how the image will appear to learners.

.. note::
  On edX.org, the course image you add in Studio is used on the learner
  dashboard, but does not automatically appear on the course About page. Work
  directly with your edX partner manager to set up the About page assets and
  course image for the course summary page.

.. _Add a Course Video:

*********************************
Adding a Course About Video
*********************************

The course "about" video appears on the course **About** page.

An example of the dashboard for a course with an about video follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/about-page-course-video.png
 :alt: Image of the course about video in the course summary page.
 :width: 600

The purpose of the about video is to entice potential learners to enroll, and
reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

An about video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or college is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

The video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than 2 minutes.

Before you upload a course about video, make sure that it follows the same
:ref:`Compression Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as your
course content videos.

.. note::

  * If you upload both a course image and a course about video, the course
    image appears on learner dashboards with a **play** icon superimposed on
    it. If you upload only a course video, the first frame of the the video
    file appears with the **play** icon.

  * The process for adding a course about video is different than the process
    for including videos as part of the content of your course. For more
    information about including video content, see :ref:`Working with Video
    Components`.
