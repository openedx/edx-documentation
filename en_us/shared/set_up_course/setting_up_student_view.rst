Setting Details About Your Course
######################################################

This topic describes how to set details about your course in Studio. The
details you set affect the information that learners see on the course
**About** page and on their dashboards. You configure the contents of these
pages in Studio.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

For information about setting the start and end dates for your course, see
:ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

For information about setting the course license, see :ref:`Licensing a
Course`.

For information about the learner dashboard, see :ref:`SFD Dashboard
Settings Profile`.

.. _The Course About Page:

***********************************
The Course About Page
***********************************

The course **About** page, sometimes called the course summary page, provides
information about your course to learners. In addition to the course
:ref:`start and end dates<Scheduling Your Course>` and an overview of course
objectives, the **About** page can include a course description with course
prerequisites, requirements, and the team biographies. Learners can see the
**About** page before they enroll in the course, and might decide to enroll
based on the content of the page.

For more information, see :ref:`View Start and End Dates`.

.. _The Learner Dashboard:

***********************************
The Learner Dashboard
***********************************

After a learner enrolls in a course, the course is listed on that learner's
dashboard. From the dashboard, a learner can access the courseware for a course
that has started. If the course has not started, or has already ended, the
dashboard shows the start or end date.

     times.

For more information, see :ref:`View Start and End Dates`.

.. _Describe Your Course:

************************
Describe Your Course
************************

Learners see the description of your course on the course **About** page. For
example, the course description is circled in the following course **About**
page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/about-page-course-description.png
 :alt: A course About page with the description circled.
 :width: 600

.. only:: Partners

  .. note:: For courses running on edX.org, you must communicate the course
   description to your edX Partner Manager to ensure the content is accurate
   on the course **About** page.

Given the diversity of online learners, be sure to review your course
description to ensure that it clearly communicates the target audience, level,
and prerequisites for your course. Use concrete, unambiguous phrasing, such as
a prerequisite of "understand eigenvalue decomposition" rather than
"intermediate linear algebra".

To provide a description for your course, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Introducing Your Course** section, locate the **Course Overview**
   field.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/course_overview.png
    :alt: Image of the HTML course description.
    :width: 600

#. Overwrite the content as needed for your course, following the directions in
   the boilerplate text. Do not edit HTML tags. For a template that includes
   placeholders, see :ref:`A Template For Course Overview`.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. To test how the description will appear to learners, select **your course
   summary page** from the text that follows the **Course Overview** field.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

.. _Add a Course Image:

************************
Add a Course Image
************************

The course image is an image file that you upload to Studio. The course image
appears on the learner dashboard. The image file should be a minimum of 378
pixels in width by 225 pixels in height, and must be in .jpg or .png format.
Make sure the image that you upload maintains the aspect ratio of those
dimensions so that the image appears correctly on the dashboard.

In the following example, the course image that was added in Studio is circled
in the dashboard.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dashboard-course-image.png
 :alt: Image of the course image in the dashboard.
 :width: 600

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Course Image** section, select **Upload Course Image**, and then
   follow the prompts to find and upload your image. To specify an image that
   has already been :ref:`added to the course<Add Files to a Course>`, select
   **files & uploads**.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

#. View your dashboard to test how the image will appear to learners.

.. only:: Partners

  .. note::
    For courses running on edX.org, the course image you add in Studio is used
    on the learner dashboard, but does not automatically appear on the course
    **About** page. Work directly with your edX Partner Manager to set up the
    **About** page assets and course image for the course summary page.

.. _Add a Course Video:

*********************************
Add a Course Video
*********************************

The course video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll, and
reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

The video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or institution is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

The video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than 2 minutes.

Ensure your course introduction video follows the same :ref:`Compression
Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as course content videos.

Learners access the course video from the course **About** page. In this
example, the video **play** option appears over the course image. When learners
select **play**, the video player opens and the course video plays.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/  about-page-course-video.png
 :alt: Image of the course video in the course summary page.
 :width: 600

To add a course video, follow these steps.

#. Upload the course video to YouTube. Make note of the code that appears
   between ``watch?v=`` and ``&feature`` in the URL. This code appears in the
   green box below.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/youtube_video_id.png
    :alt: Image of a sample course video.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Course Introduction Video** section, locate the field below the
   video box.

#. Enter the YouTube video ID (the code you copied in step 1). When you add the
   code, the video automatically loads in the video box.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

#. View your course **About** page to test how the video will appear to
   learners.

.. only:: Partners

  .. note::
    For courses running on edX.org, you work directly with your Partner Manager
    to set up the course video in the summary page.

.. _Set Course Effort Expectations:

*******************************
Set Course Effort Expectations
*******************************

The estimated effort that the course requires appears in the course **About**
page.

To set the hours and minutes a week estimate in Studio, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Requirements** section, locate the **Hours of Effort per Week**
   field.

#. Enter the number of hours you expect learners to work on this course each
   week.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

#. View your course **About** page to test how the requirements will appear to
   learners.
