Specify Prerequisite Courses

You can require that your students pass a particular edX course before they
enroll in your course. Students see information about course prerequisites on
the course About page.

If students have not completed the prerequisite course, they can enroll in your
course and then see your course on the Student Dashboard. However, unlike with
other courses, the Student Dashboard does not provide a link to the courseware.
The Student Dashboard includes a link to the About page for the prerequisite
course. Students can enroll in the prerequisite course from the About page.

      unavailable because it has a prerequisite.

To define one course as the prerequisite for another, you must be the course
creator in both the current course and in the prerequisite course.

To specify a prerequisite course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, scroll to the **Requirements** section.
#. Under **Prerequisite Course**, select a course from the list.
#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

.. note:: Currently, you can specify only one prerequisite course.


.. _Require an Entrance Exam:

****************************
Require an Entrance Exam
****************************

You can require your students to pass an entrance exam before they access your
course materials. If you include an entrance exam, students who enroll in your
course see only the **Course Updates & News** page and an **Entrance Exam** tab
until they pass the exam.

   the left.


After students pass the exam, they can access all released materials in your
course.

To require an entrance exam, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open your course.
#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.
#. On the **Schedule & Details** page, scroll to the **Requirements** section.
#. Select the **Require students to pass an exam before accessing course
   materials** check box.
#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

After you save your changes, Studio automatically creates an **Entrance Exam**
section in your course outline. To add content to your entrance exam, go to the
course outline.

==================================
Best Practices for Entrance Exams
==================================

We strongly recommend that you follow several guidelines to help you and your
students have a positive experience with entrance exams.

* Make sure that your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test
  your other course content.

* Make sure that you mention the entrance exam in the course description on
  your course About page. Otherwise, students will not know about the entrance
  exam before they enroll in your course and try to access course content.

* Add an anouncement at the top of the **Course Updates & News** page that
  contains information and instructions for students who need to take the exam.
  When students first try to access content in a course that has an entrance
  exam, they see the **Course Updates & News** page. We suggest that you
  include the following information.

  * To begin the course entrance exam, students click the **Entrance Exam** tab
    on the left side of the screen.

  * After students complete the entrance exam, they have to click the
    **Entrance Exam** tab again or refresh the page in their browser. When the
    page refreshes, students can see all currently available course content.

================================================
Create an Entrance Exam from the Course Outline
================================================

You create your course entrance exam from the course outline in Studio.
Creating entrance exam content is just like creating other course content. For
more information, see :ref:`Course Components Index`.

==================================
Adjust Scores in the Entrance Exam
==================================

If you find an error in the exam after students have taken it, and corrections
to the exam are unavoidable, you have several options to rescore the exam for
individual students. These options are available on the Instructor Dashboard.

On the Instructor Dashboard, click **Student Admin**, and then scroll to the
**Entrance Exam Grade Adjustment** section. The following options are
available.

* **Reset Student Attempts**: Reset the value for one particular student's
  attempts back to zero so that the student can begin work over again. For more
  information, see :ref:`reset_attempts`.

* **Rescore Student Submission**: Rescore the responses that a student has
  submitted. For more information, see :ref:`rescore`.

* **Delete Student State for Problem**: Delete a student's entire history for
  the exam from the database. For more information, see :ref:`delete_state`.

Another option on the Instructor Dashboard is **Show Background Task History
for Student**. If you reset student attempts, rescore student submissions, or
delete student state, the operation runs in the background. If you want to see
a record of all the operations that have run for the entrance exam, select
**Show Background Task History for Student**.
