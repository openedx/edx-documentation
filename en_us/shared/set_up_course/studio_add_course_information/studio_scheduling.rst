Set the Course Run Schedule and Pacing
######################################

After you determine the start and end dates for a course run, and whether you
want your course run to be self-paced or instructor-paced, you specify these
settings on the **Schedule & Details** page in Studio.

For more information about determining how to schedule your course, see :ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

.. only:: Partners

 .. note::
   You enter the course run start and end dates and pacing in Publisher when
   you create a course run. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Create a Course
   Run`. You must also enter this information in Studio before the course run
   begins.

.. only:: Partners

 To set dates and times for the course in Studio, follow these steps.

.. only:: Open_edX

 To set dates and times for the course and for course enrollment in Studio,

.. note::
 EdX recommends that you verify all important dates in Studio one week before
 you plan to start the course.

#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Course Schedule** section, replace the placeholder dates and times
   with your own information.

   When you make changes on this page, a panel with options to save or cancel
   your work appears.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

.. note::
  The times that you set are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). You might
  want to verify that you have specified the times that you intend by using a
  time zone converter such as `Time and Date Time Zone Converter`_.

.. _Advertise a Different Start Date:

====================================
Advertise a Different Start Date
====================================

You can advertise a start date for your course that is different from the
course start date you set in the **Schedule & Details** page. You might want
to do this if the exact start date is uncertain.

You can enter a specific date or a description. For example, you could
advertise the start date as either "15 Oct 2016" or "Anytime, self-paced".

To set an advertised start date in Studio, follow these steps.

#. On the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Course Advertised Start Date** field. The default value is
   ``null``.

#. Enter the start date that you want learners to see for your course in
   MM/DD/YYYY format.

   A date value entered in MM/DD/YYYY format appears to learners in DD Mon YYYY
   format. For example, 10/15/2016 appears as 15 Oct 2016.

#. Add quotation marks (``" "``) before and after the start date value. An
   example follows.

   ::

     "Anytime, self-paced"

#. Select **Save Changes**.

   A message lets you know whether your changes were saved successfully.

.. note::
 If you do not change the default course start date (01/01/2030), and the
 **Course Advertised Start Date** policy value is ``null``, no start date
 appears for the course. Learners just see that the course has not yet started.
