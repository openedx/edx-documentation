############################

When you have determined what licenses you want your course content to have,
you set course content licensing in Studio.

For more information about licensing options, see :ref:`Licensing a Course`.

When you create a new course, the license is set to **All Rights Reserved**.
You can change the license for your course in the **Schedule & Details** page
in Studio.

The license options that you select apply to all course content, including
videos, unless you explicitly specify different licensing options for your
videos. Learners see the license at the bottom of all pages in the course.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the **Course Content License**
   section.
