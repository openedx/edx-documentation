Learners see a description of your course on the course About page, under the
heading "About this course". The course description contains the following
information about your course.

* The long course description. This description contains 150-400 words.
* Names of course staff, together with short bios and images. For best results,
  course staff images should be 110 x 110 px.

Additionally, a course description can contain the following information.

* Skill and knowledge prerequisites.
* Frequently asked questions.
* Available languages for text, videos, and video transcripts.

For more information about creating an effective course description, see
:ref:`Course Description`.

To provide a description for your course, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Introducing Your Course** section, locate the **Course Overview**
   field. This field contains a raw HTML template with placeholders for your
   course content.

#. Overwrite the placeholder content with information for your course,
   following the directions in the template. Do not edit HTML tags.

   If you want to include information that does not have a specific section in
   the template, such as languages, you can add this information in the "About
   This Course" section.

#. To test how the description will appear to learners, locate the text that
   follows the **Course Overview** field, and then select **your course summary
   page**.

#. Select **Save Changes**.
