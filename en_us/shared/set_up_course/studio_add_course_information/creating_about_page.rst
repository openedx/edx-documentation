   .. note:: If the CourseTalk widget is enabled for your instance of the Open edX
      platform, the About page for every course also includes the CourseTalk
      widget. Learners who have enrolled in your course use this widget to write
      reviews of your course on the **Course** page in the LMS. These reviews are
      then visible on the course About page. For more information, see
      :ref:`installation:Add CourseTalk`.

Learners see a description of your course on the course About page, under the
heading "About this course". The course description contains the following
information about your course.

* The long course description. This description contains 150-400 words.
* Names of course staff, together with short bios and images. For best results,
  course staff images should be 110 x 110 px.

Additionally, a course description can contain the following information.

* Skill and knowledge prerequisites.
* Frequently asked questions.
* Available languages for text, videos, and video transcripts.

For more information about creating an effective course description, see
:ref:`Course Description`.

To provide a description for your course, follow these steps.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. In the **Introducing Your Course** section, locate the **Course Overview**
   field. This field contains a raw HTML template with placeholders for your
   course content.

#. Overwrite the placeholder content with information for your course,
   following the directions in the template. Do not edit HTML tags.

   If you want to include information that does not have a specific section in
   the template, such as languages, you can add this information in the "About
   This Course" section.

#. To test how the description will appear to learners, locate the text that
   follows the **Course Overview** field, and then select **your course summary
   page**.

#. Select **Save Changes**.
