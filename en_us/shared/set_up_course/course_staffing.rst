About the Course Team Roles
**************************************

To give team members access to Studio, the instructor dashboard in the LMS, and
Insights, you assign one of these course team roles to them.

* Staff

* Admin

You can assign these privileged roles when you work in either the LMS or
Studio. The people who have these roles can work on your course in Studio, the
LMS, and Insights. For more information about assigning roles to team members
in Studio, see :ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course or to moderate
and manage its discussions by assigning other roles in the LMS. Beta testers
and discussion team members must be enrolled in your course, but they do not
need to have the Staff or Admin role. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

.. _Administrative Team Roles:

****************************
Administrative Team Roles

To provide access to features on the instructor dashboard in the LMS, you
assign the Staff role or the Admin role.

Team members with the **Staff** role can complete the following tasks.

* View the course before the course start date.

* Access and modify grades for individual learners. For example, users with the
  Staff role can reset an individual learner's attempt to answer a question.

Course team members who have the **Admin** role can complete all the tasks that
course team members who have the Staff role can complete. They can also
complete the following tasks.

* Access and modify grades for all learners in a course. For example, users
  with the Admin role can reset all learners' attempts to answer a question.

* Add and remove staff.

* Add and remove other admins.

* Add and remove beta testers.

* Add and remove discussion admins, discussion moderators, and discussion
  community TAs.

  .. note:: To moderate course discussions, team members must have one
   of these discussion roles assigned to them *in addition to* the Staff or
   Admin role. For more information, see :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

Before you can assign the Staff or Admin role to a team member, you must meet
these prerequisites.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Membership**.

#. In the **Course Team Management** section, select **Staff** or **Admin**.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email
   address or username, and then select **Add** for the role type.

To remove an assigned role, view the list of users and then select **Revoke
access**.


.. _Add Course Team Members:

Add Course Team Members
************************

Course team members are users who help you build your course. Before you can
assign Staff or Admin access to a team member, you must meet these
prerequisites.

* You must be an Admin.

* The team member that you want to add must register a user account and
  activate the account.

* You need the same, registered email address for the team member you want to
  add.

Other course team members can edit the course and perform all tasks except
adding and removing other team members and granting Admin access.

.. note::  Any course team member can delete content created by other team
 members.

To add a course team member, follow these steps.

#. Ensure you have Admin access.
#. Ensure that the new team member has registered and activated an account.
#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Course Team**.
#. Select **Add a New Team Member**.
#. Enter the new team member's email address, then select **ADD USER**.

The new team member can now work on the course in Studio.

* To preview the course in the LMS, the team member must enroll in the course.

* To moderate course discussions, the team member must also have one of the
  discussion roles. For more information, see
  :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

You can also assign privileged roles to users when you work in the LMS by
selecting **Instructor** and then **Membership**.

Regardless of where the role is assigned, these administrative team members can
work on your course in Studio immediately, and use the LMS and Insights after
enrollment. For more information about assigning roles while you run your
course, see :ref:`Course_Staffing`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but
they do not need to have Staff or Admin access. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
