Course Search
#####################

Learners can search much of the content of your edX course, including the
course title, description, text, and video transcripts. Learners can
search inside individual courses, or they can search all the courses that they
are enrolled in at one time. When learners search all their courses at one
time, they can filter search results based on course subject, type, and
language.

Before learners can search your course, Studio must index your course content.
Studio indexes your course content automatically every time you make a change
to the content. You can also manually begin an indexing operation in Studio.
To do this, select **Reindex** in the upper right corner of the **Course
Outline** page.

The search engine returns not only exact matches for search terms, but also
matches that contain the search term. These matches must contain the entire
search term. For example, a search for "grade" returns results for "grades"
and "graded", but a search for "graded" would not return "grade" or "grades".

When the search engine returns results, either for an individual course or
across all courses, learners can select any search result to view that result
in the course body.

For more information about the student experience, see `Searching the Course <http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/open-edx-learner-guide/en/latest/SFD_course_search.html>`_.

.. note::
 Studio indexes most content that learners see on the **Course** page. However,
 Studio does not index course exercises and problems, including homework and
 exam problems. Studio also does not index course handouts or discussions.
 However, learners can search course discussions by using the **Search all
 posts** field on the **Discussions** page.
