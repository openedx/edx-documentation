   You can create courses on the edX Edge site only if you have course creation
   permissions. For more information, see :ref:`Use Studio on Edge`. Only edX
   staff members can create courses on edx.org.

Another way to create a course is for a system administrator to re-run an
existing course. For more information, see :ref:`Rerun a Course`.

You can also :ref:`export<Export a Course>` and :ref:`import<Import a Course>`
courses as XML files. You can do this when you need to back up a course or edit
the course in XML.

.. _Identifying the Course:

**************************
Identifying the Course
**************************

Before you create a course, consider the identifying information that you will
provide for it carefully.

* For **Course Name**, you enter the title of your course. For example, the
  name might be "Sets, Maps, and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for
  the course title, and normal spacing and punctuation.

* For **Organization**, you enter the identifier for your organization. Do not
  include spaces or special characters.

* For **Course Number**, you enter both a subject abbreviation and a number.
  For example, for public health course number 207, enter ``PH207``. For math
  course 101x, enter ``Math101x``. Do not include spaces or special characters
  in the course number.

  .. note:: If your course will be public, be sure to include the "x".
      If it is exclusively an on campus offering, do not include the "x".

* For **Course Run**, you enter the term in which your course will run. For
  example, enter 2014SOND or T2_2014. Do not include spaces or special
  characters.

  The value that you enter for the run does not affect the course start date
  that you define for the course. For more information, see :ref:`Scheduling
  Your Course`.

The organization, course number, and course run values that you enter are used
to create the URL for your course. Because URLs do not have an unlimited
length, the total number of characters that you enter for these values must be
65 or fewer.

.. important:: The values that you enter for the organization, course number,
 and course run cannot be edited after you create your course.

      creating a new course: Course Name, Organization, Course Number, and
      Course Run.

   The :ref:`Course Outline<Developing Your Course Outline>` page opens. You

   :ref:`Getting Started with Course Content Development`.

.. _Edit Your Course:

************************

After you create a course, the course opens in Studio automatically and you can
begin editing. Your next steps might include adding other :ref:`course team
members<Add Course Team Members>`, setting the course :ref:`start and end
dates<Scheduling Your Course>`, or developing the :ref:`course
outline<Developing Your Course Outline>`.

When you return to Studio later, your **My Courses** dashboard page lists
the courses that you created as well as any courses for which you have course
team privileges.
