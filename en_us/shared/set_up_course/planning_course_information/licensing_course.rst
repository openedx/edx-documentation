You can specify licensing options for your course content as well as for each
video in your course. By specifying the license, you communicate to learners
whether and how they can reuse your course content.

You specify licensing options in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Set
Course Content Licensing`.

.. _Set Video Licensing:

*************************************
Set Video Licensing
*************************************

If you intend for a specific video to have a different license than the course
as a whole, you must set the license in the :ref:`Video Advanced Options`.

For example, you might license for your course under Creative Commons, but use
a video from another party that is copyrighted. In this case, you can set the
license for that particular video to **All Rights Reserved**.

If a video is to have the same license as the course as a whole, you do not
need to set the license for the video.

.. _Learners View of Licenses:

*************************************
Learners' View of Licenses
*************************************

When they view content in the **Course** tab, learners see the license that
you set for the course at the bottom of the page.

If the video has a different license than the course as a whole, learners see
the license at the bottom right of the video player.

For the course and for videos, if you choose **All Rights Reserved**, learners
see **All Rights Reserved**; if you choose **Creative Commons** and select any
allowed combination of options, learners see **Some Rights Reserved** and can
select the link to see details.
