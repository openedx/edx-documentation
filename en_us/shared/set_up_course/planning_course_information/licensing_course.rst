**************************************
Set Course Content Licensing in Studio
**************************************

When you have determined what licenses you want your course content to have,
you set course content licensing in Studio.

For more information about licensing options, see :ref:`Licensing a Course`.

When you create a new course, the license is set to **All Rights Reserved**.
You can change the license for your course in the **Schedule & Details** page
in Studio.

The license options that you select apply to all course content, including
videos, unless you explicitly specify different licensing options for your
videos. Learners see the license at the bottom of all pages in the course.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the page to view the **Course Content License**

.. _Set Video Licensing:

*************************************
Set Video Licensing
*************************************

If you intend for a specific video to have a different license than the course
as a whole, you must set the license in the :ref:`video additional options <Video
Additional Options>`.

For example, you might license for your course under Creative Commons, but use
a video from another party that is copyrighted. In this case, you can set the
license for that particular video to **All Rights Reserved**.

If a video is to have the same license as the course as a whole, you do not
need to set the license for the video.

.. _Learners View of Licenses:

*************************************
Learners' View of Licenses
*************************************

When they view content in the **Course** tab, learners see the license that
you set for the course at the bottom of the page.
