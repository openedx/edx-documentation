  If learners have not completed the prerequisite course, they can enroll in
  your course and then see your course on their learner dashboards. However,
  unlike with other courses, the dashboard does not provide a link to the
  course content. The dashboard includes a link to the **About** page for the
  prerequisite course. Learners can enroll in the prerequisite course from the
  **About** page.

  exam. After learners pass the exam, they can access all released materials in
  your course.

  an Entrance Exam`.

  ==================================
  Best Practices for Entrance Exams
  ==================================

  We strongly recommend that you follow several guidelines to help you and your
  learners have a positive experience with entrance exams.

  * Make sure that your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test
    your other course content.

  * Make sure that you mention the entrance exam in the course description on
    your course **About** page. Otherwise, learners will not know about the
    entrance exam before they enroll in your course and try to access course
    content.

  * Add an announcement to the **Course Updates & News** page that contains
    information and instructions for learners who need to take the exam. When
    learners first try to access content in a course that has an entrance exam,
    they see the **Course Updates & News** page. We suggest that you include
    the following information.

    * To begin the course entrance exam, learners select **Entrance Exam**.

    * After learners complete the entrance exam, they must select **Entrance
      Exam** again or refresh the page in their browsers. After the page
      refreshes, learners can access all currently available course content.
