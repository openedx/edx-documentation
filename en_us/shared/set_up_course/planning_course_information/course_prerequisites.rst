When you require that your learners pass a particular edX course before they
enroll in your course, learners see information about course prerequisites on
the course **About** page.

If learners have not completed the prerequisite course, they can enroll in your
course and then see your course on their learner dashboards. However, unlike
with other courses, the dashboard does not provide a link to the course
content. The dashboard includes a link to the **About** page for the
prerequisite course. Learners can enroll in the prerequisite course from the
**About** page.

You can require your learners to pass an entrance exam before they access your
course materials. If you include an entrance exam, learners who enroll in your
course can access only the **Entrance Exam** page until they pass the exam.
After learners pass the exam, they can access all released materials in your
course.

an Entrance Exam`.

==================================
Best Practices for Entrance Exams
==================================

We strongly recommend that you follow several guidelines to help you and your
learners have a positive experience with entrance exams.

* Make sure that your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test
  your other course content.

* Make sure that you mention the entrance exam in the course description on
  your course **About** page. Otherwise, learners will not know about the
  entrance exam before they enroll in your course and try to access course
  content.

* Add an announcement to the **Course Updates & News** page that contains
  information and instructions for learners who need to take the exam. When
  learners first try to access content in a course that has an entrance exam,
  they see the **Course Updates & News** page. We suggest that you include the
  following information.

  * To begin the course entrance exam, learners select **Entrance Exam**.

  * After learners complete the entrance exam, they must select
    **Entrance Exam** again or refresh the page in their browsers. After the
    page refreshes, learners can access all currently available course content.
