Given the diversity of online learners, be sure to review your course
description to ensure that it clearly communicates the target audience, level,
and prerequisites for your course. Use concrete, unambiguous phrasing, such as
a prerequisite of "understand eigenvalue decomposition" rather than
"intermediate linear algebra".

* Contains 150–300 words.
* Is easy to skim.
* Uses bullet points instead of dense text paragraphs.
* Follows SEO guidelines.
* Targets a global audience.
