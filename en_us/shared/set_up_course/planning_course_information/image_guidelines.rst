Images for courses and programs must follow specific size guidelines.


Course Image Size
*****************

  The course image size must be 2120 x 1192 pixels. However, only part of this
  image may be visible. The viewable area varies according to the web page
  where the viewer sees the image.

  The following example course image is 2120 x 1192 pixels. The image shows the
  area of a course image that is always visible, as well as the areas that are
  also visible on different pages. You can click to enlarge the image.

         the additional area visible for program pages and the learner
         dashboard, and the area that may be hidden in search results.

.. only:: Open_edX

  The course image that you add in Studio appears on the About page for the
  course and on the learner dashboard. It must be a minimum of 378 pixels in
  width by 225 pixels in height, and in .jpg or .png format. Make sure the
  image that you upload maintains the aspect ratio of those dimensions so that
  the image appears correctly on the dashboard.

Program Image Size
******************

The program image size must be 1440 x 260 pixels. However, only part of this
image may be visible. The viewable area varies according to the web page where
the viewer sees the image.

The following example program image is 1440 x 260 pixels. The image shows the
area of a program image that is always visible, as well as the areas that are
also visible on different pages. You can click to enlarge the image.

       the area that may be hidden in search results.




.. _Course About Video Guidelines:

=============================
Course About Video Guidelines
=============================

The course About video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll,
and reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

This video should answer these key questions.

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or institution is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

This video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than two minutes.

Before you upload a course About video, make sure that it follows the same
:ref:`Compression Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as your
course content videos.

.. note::

  * If you upload both a course image and a course About video, the course
    image appears on learner dashboards with a **play** icon superimposed on
    it. If you upload only a course video, the first frame of the the video
    file appears with the **play** icon.

  * The process for adding a course about video is different than the process
    for including videos as part of the content of your course. For more
    information about including video content, see :ref:`Working with Video
    Components`.

 When you add an About video for a course, you must first upload the video to
 the edX/Veda video upload page. You can then optionally enter the URL for your
 course About video in Publisher. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Add an
 About Video` and :ref:`Pub Create a Course`.

.. only:: Open_edX

 For information about how to add an About video to your course About page, see
