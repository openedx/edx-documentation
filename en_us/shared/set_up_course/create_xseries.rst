Creating an XSeries Program
*****************************

An XSeries program is a series of 3-10 courses that students can take to master
a subject area. A learner earns an XSeries certificate when the learner earns a
verified certificate in all of the courses in an XSeries.

You can create an XSeries program in Studio. After you create the courses in
the XSeries program, you use the program administration tool in Studio to
associate the courses. The courses do not have to be complete before you add
them to an XSeries program.

For more information about XSeries programs, see the `XSeries`_ page on the edX
website.
