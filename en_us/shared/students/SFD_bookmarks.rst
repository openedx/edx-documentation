To mark course content so that you can come back to it later, you can bookmark
any course page, up to a limit of 100 bookmarks for any one course.

The course material that you bookmark is identified in the unit navigation bar
on the **Course** page, or you can see a list of all of your bookmarks on the
**My Bookmarks** page.
