Understanding Course Content Availability and Scheduling
########################################################

When you begin a course you see the sections of the course content in the left
pane of the course window. You can use the left pane to view the sections and
subsections of the course canyon and to open them in the course page.

In many courses, all of the sections and subsections of the course content are
visible in the left pane when you open the course for the first time. In some
courses, additional content may appear in the left pane as you work through the
course. New content may appear in the course because it has been scheduled for
release as a specific date or because it has prerequisite content that you must
complete first.

If you are taking an instructor-paced course, the course team schedules the
dates on which the sections of the course content become available to you. On
the date that the course team chooses, the course content appears in the left
pane. In self-paced courses, all of the course content is visible at all times.
For more information about self-paced and instructor-paced courses, see
:ref:`SFD Self Paced`.

Some sections of course content have prerequisite sections that you must
complete before they become available. Your course team sets a minimum score
that you must earn in the problems of a prerequisite section in order to
display the following sections.

Not all courses include scheduled course content or prerequisites. Your course
may display all of the course content in the left pane as soon as you begin
taking it.
