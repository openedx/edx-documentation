Understanding Course Content Availability and Scheduling
########################################################

When you begin a course, on the **Course** page you can see the sections of the
course content in the course navigation pane. You can view the sections in the
course, select each one to view its subsections, and select the subsections to
view the course material .

In some courses, all of the sections of the course content are visible in the
course navigation pane when you open the course for the first time. In other
courses, additional content becomes available as you work, either because it
was scheduled for release on a specific date, or because you completed required
content that allowed you to proceed to further content.

* In some courses, the course team schedules the dates on which the sections of
  the course content become available to you. On the date that the course team
  chooses, the course content appears in the course navigation pane.

* Some courses include content that has prerequisite sections. Prerequisite
  sections require that you complete other, previous sections before they
  become available. The course team sets a minimum score that you must earn in
  the problems of a prerequisite section in order to display the following
  sections.

Not all courses include scheduled course content or prerequisites. Your course
might display all of the course content in the course navigation pane as soon
as you begin taking it.

If you do not see the course content that you expect, you can check for
information about the course schedule and content prerequisites on the course
**Home** page or course discussions.
