Understanding Course Content Availability and Scheduling
########################################################

When you begin a course, you see the sections of the course content in the left
pane of the course window. You can use the left pane to view the sections and
subsections of the course content and to open them in the course page.

In some courses, all of the sections of the course content are visible in the
left pane when you open the course for the first time. In other courses,
additional content becomes available as you work, either because it was
scheduled for release on a specific date, or because you completed required
content that allowed you to proceed to further content.

In some courses, the course team schedules the dates on which the sections of
the course content become available to you. On the date that the course team
chooses, the course content appears in the left pane.

Some courses include content that has prerequisite sections. Prerequisite
sections require that you complete other, previous sections before they become
available. The course team sets a minimum score that you must earn in the
problems of a prerequisite section in order to display the following sections.

Not all courses include scheduled course content or prerequisites. Your course
might display all of the course content in the left pane as soon as you begin
taking it.

If you do not see course content that you expect, you can check for information
about the course schedule and content prerequisites on the course **Home** page
or course discussions.
