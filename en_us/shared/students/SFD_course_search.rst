*************************
Overview of Search
*************************

You can search much of the content of your edX courses, including the course
title, description, text, and video transcripts. You can search for a term in
an individual course, or you can search for that term in all of the courses
that you are enrolled in, whether the course is active or archived. When the
search engine returns results, either for an individual course or across all
courses, you can select any search result to view that result inside the
course.

.. note::
 You can search for most content that you see on the **Course** page.
 However,course exercises and problems, including homework and exam problems,
 are not currently searchable.

The search engine returns not only exact matches for search terms, but also
matches that contain the search term. These matches must contain the entire
search term. For example, a search for "grade" returns results for "grades"
and "graded", but a search for "graded" would not return "grade" or "grades".

*************************
Search a Single Course
*************************

To search for a term in a single course, go to the **Course** page for
that course, enter your search term in the **Search** field in the upper left
corner of the page, and then press Enter. Your search term can contain more
than one word.

After you press Enter, your search results appear in the right pane. The
search results include the following items.

* Your search term.
* A brief excerpt from the surrounding text.
* The place in the course where the search term appears.

To view your search term in the body of the course, select **View** to the
right of the search result.

.. note:: You cannot use the **Search** field on the **Course** tab to
 search course discussions. To search course discussions, use the **Search all
 posts** field on the **Discussions** tab. For more information, see
 :ref:`Course Discussions Index`.

*************************
Search All Your Courses
*************************

You can search for a term across all your edX courses. To do this, go to your
dashboard, enter your search term in the **Search Your Courses** field in the
upper right corner of the page, and then press Enter. Your search term can
contain more than one word.

  term in bold.
* The name of the course and the place in the course where the search term
  appears.
* The type of content, such as text or video, that contains the search term.

To view your search term in the body of the course, select **View** to the
