******************
Overview of Notes
******************

As you work through an edX course, you may want to highlight a particular
passage or make a note about what you have read. In some edX courses, you can
highlight passages and make notes right in the courseware. 

.. note:: You can create notes for most text in the courseware. 
 However, notes are currently not available for exercises, videos, or PDF
 textbooks.

When a course includes the notes feature, every page has a **Notes** page at
the top and a pencil icon in the lower right corner.

      highlighted text with an accompanying note, and the pencil icon in the
      lower right corner.

Your notes can contain text as well as tags that help you organize and find
your notes. You can see individual notes inside the course content, or you can
see all of your notes at once on the **Notes** page. For more information, see
:ref:`The Notes Page`.


.. _SFD SN Add Note:

******************************************
Highlight a Passage or Add a Note
******************************************

You can use either the mouse or keyboard shortcuts to create, access, and
delete notes. For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see
:ref:`SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts`.

To highlight a passage or add a note that includes text and tags, follow these
steps.

#. Select the text that you want to highlight or make the note about. You can
   select as much text as you want.

#. When a pencil "edit" icon appears above the selected text, select
   the icon to open the note editor.

         text.

#. When the note editor opens, enter your note and any tags that you want to
   add. You can also save the highlight for the passage without entering a
   note or tag.

   * To highlight a passage without adding a note or tag, select **Save** or
     press Enter. When you move your cursor over the highlighted text, the note field
     contains the words "no comment".

   * To enter a note, select **Comments**, and then type the text of your note.
     Your note can contain as many words as you want.

   * To add one or more tags, select **Add some tags here**, and then type any
     tags that you want to add. 

     Tags cannot contain spaces. If you want to add a tag that has more than
     one word, type multiple words as one word with no spaces, or use hyphens
     (-) or underscores (_) to separate words in the tag.

   highlighted.

.. _SFD SN View Note:

***************************
View Notes
***************************

You can view your course notes in two places. 

* You can view individual notes on the page where you created
  the notes. To see your notes, go to the unit that contains your note and
  move your cursor over or select the highlighted text. When you select the
  highlighted text, your note remains open until you move outside the
  highlighted text.

* You can view all the notes you have made in the course on the **Notes** page.
  You can also search your notes on this page.

.. _The Notes Page:

On the **Notes** page, you can see all the notes you have made in your course
in one place. You can also search the text of your notes.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_SN_NotesPage.png

  :alt: Notes page showing a list of notes ordered by recent activity.

The **Notes** page shows you both the text that you selected and the note that
you made. You can also see the following information next to each note.

* A link to the location in the course that contains the highlighted text and
  your note. To go to that location, select the link under **Noted in**.
* The time and date when you last edited the note.
* Any tags that you added.

The **Notes** page has three different views: **Recent Activity**, **Location
in Course**, and **Tags**.

* When you select **Recent Activity**, notes are sorted by the date you
  created or edited them, with the most recently modified first.

* When you select **Location in Course**, notes are sorted sequentially by the
  location of the note in the courseware. 

* When you select **Tags**, notes are sorted by the tags you have added.

  * The most frequently used tags are at the top of the list. The number of
    notes that have a particular tag appears in parentheses after the tag.
  * If some tags have the same number of notes, those tags are sorted
    alphabetically.
  * Notes without tags are at the bottom of the list.
