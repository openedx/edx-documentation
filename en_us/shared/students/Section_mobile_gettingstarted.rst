You need to have an edX account before you can enroll in courses. You can sign
up for an edX account in the edX mobile app, or use a browser to go to the
`edx.org`_ website. When you create your account, you need to be connected to
the Internet.

When you open the edX mobile app, select **Sign up and start learning**. You
can create an edX account using your email address or your Facebook or Google
account. You also provide the following information.

* Your name.

After you create your account, you can find courses that interest you and
enroll in them.

mobile-friendly courses that you are currently enrolled in. At the end of the
list, select **Find a Mobile-Friendly Course**.
