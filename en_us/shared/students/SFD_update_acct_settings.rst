Change the Language for the Site
*********************************

You can choose the language that you want the edx.org site to use during your
visits. The language setting changes the appearance of menu options, button
labels, and other elements of the site's user interface, but it does not apply
to course content.

.. note:: Your dashboard and course pages are available in more languages than
   the catalog pages where you search for courses and programs. If you
   choose a language that is not supported on the course and program catalog
   pages, those pages are displayed in English.

   The list of languages in the language selection dropdown menu in the footer
   of the page reflects the languages that the page is available in.


There are two ways of changing the edx.org site's language.

      reflect the languages that are supported on that page.

      dropdown list than on your dashboard and course pages.
