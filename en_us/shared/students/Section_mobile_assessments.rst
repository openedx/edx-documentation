.. _Assessment Questions:

==================================================================
Can I use the edX mobile app to do my homework?
==================================================================

You can use the edX mobile app to do some, but probably not all, of the
problems in your assignments. EdX courses include a variety of problem types.
Currently, you can read questions and submit answers only for problem types
that require a simple action as a response.

For example, you can use the edX app to answer multiple choice questions, but
you cannot use it to draw molecules or design circuits. To complete problems
that require complex actions, you must use a web browser.

.. note:: EdX recommends that you complete all of your graded assignments in
 a web browser on a computer.

========================================================
What types of problems can I do?
========================================================

The edX mobile app is best suited for completing ungraded, practice problems.

In the edX mobile app, you can do problems that you answer in one of these
ways.

* Multiple choice selection
* Dropdown list selection
* Checkbox selection
* Text input
* Numerical input

EdX is working to add more types of problems to this list.

==================================================================
Can I read all of the questions for my assignments in the app?
==================================================================

No. After you select the **Full Course** option, the list includes every
section in the course. After you select a section, a "readable" (piece of
paper) icon or a "web only" (PC) icon appears next to each piece of content.

When you select a readable assignment, you can read and answer questions in the
app. For graded assignments, edX recommends that you review the entire
assignment in a web browser to make sure that you read and answer all of the
questions.

When you select a web only assignment, you can follow a link to open that part
of the course in a web browser. The question does not appear in the app.
