Online Proctoring Rules
##############################

EdX.org uses an online proctoring service for certain exams (typically final
exams) that are part of courses that can be made eligible for credit. If you
are taking proctored exams, you are required to adhere to the following rules
to receive a Pass result from the proctoring service.

You are responsible for testing your computer with the proctoring software
well in advance of all online proctored exams in your courses, so that you can
fix any problems that you discover before the exams. You can test your system
by trying the example proctored exam in the free Demo Course on edX.org.

Before the exam, read the rules below to make sure you can take a proctored
exam in an environment and with a computer that meets requirements.

As with other ID-verified assessments and exams, you will be asked to
establish your identity during the proctored exam process by supplying a
government-issued photo ID.

Online Proctoring Requirements
******************************

To pass a proctored exam, you must adhere to the following rules with regard
to the room that you take the proctored exam in, and the computer and tools
that you use during the exam. In addition, you must not act in any way that
violates the behavior requirements.


=====================================
The Room You Take the Exam In
=====================================

#. Make sure the room is well lit. The lighting in the room must be bright
   enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred.
   If overhead lighting is not available, make sure the source of light does
   not come from behind you.

#. Sit at a clean desk or table, not on a bed or couch.

#. Clear the desk or table of all materials such as phones, books, papers,
   notebooks, calculators, and so on, unless you have been specifically
   permitted (in posted guidelines) to have such materials available for a
   particular examination.

   In addition to pens, paper, calculators, textbooks, and notebooks, the
   following tools should not be on your desk or used during your proctored
   exam.

  * Smartphones or other communication devices.
  * Programs such as Excel, Word, Powerpoint.

   computer on which you are taking the exam.

The Computer You Use to Take the Exam
==========================================

#. Make sure you do not have more than one display or monitor connected to the
