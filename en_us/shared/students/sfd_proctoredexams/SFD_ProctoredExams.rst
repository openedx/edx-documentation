****************************
Proctored Exams Overview
****************************

If you are taking a course for credit as a Verified track student, it is
important that edX can make sure that you took and passed required exams in the
course without cheating or using a false identity. Proctored exams use
software to check that the person taking the exam is the same person who is
taking the course for credit, and also to detect any attempts to cheat on the
exam.

Read :ref:`edX's Online Proctoring Policy <Online Proctoring Rules>` to make
sure you know what is required, before you agree to take an exam with online
proctoring.

If an exam in your course is marked as a proctored exam, you can choose to
take the exam without proctoring, but you will not be eligible for credit for
it, and you will not be offered the proctored option for that exam again.

If you take an exam as a proctored exam, you must pass the proctoring review,
otherwise you cannot earn credit for your course even if you have attained a
passing grade.

If you are not ready to take the exam right now, you can return to it and make
your choice later, although you should give yourself enough time to take it
before the due date.

**********************************
Before Taking a Proctored Exam
**********************************


#. If you need to request extra time allowance for the exam, do so before you
   make any choices on the exam page.

#. Make sure your computer meets the minimum system requirements for running
   the remote proctoring software.

#. Make sure you have only a single monitor connected to your computer, or
   that you are not using a secondary display if you are using a laptop.

#. Certain communication apps are prohibited while you are taking a proctored
   exam. Make sure you shut down programs such as Skype or XXX? before you
   start taking a proctored exam.

================================
Requesting Additional Time 
================================

In certain circumstances you might need more time to complete your proctored
exam. Be sure to ask your course team or instructor about this possibility
before making your choice to take the exam as a proctored exam. They will need
to approve your request and add time to your specific exam before you start
your exam.

================================
Requirements for Proctored Exams
================================

You must be on certain versions of the Windows or Mac operating systems for
the proctoring software to work. Check the list to make sure you are using a
supported operating system version.

How Proctored Exams Work
****************************

When you agree to take a proctored exam, you agree to install remote
proctoring software, perform various identification and environment checks,
and allow the software to record video and sounds while you take the exam.

=======================================
Choose to take a Proctored Exam
=======================================

After you choose proctoring, you see a page with a unique exam code. The code
is unique to your edX account and to this exam; do not share it. It can only
be used once. You will be asked for this code during the proctoring set up.
Copy this code so that you can paste it when you are prompted to do so.

=======================================
Perform the System Checks
=======================================

The Remote Proctor Now system check window opens. The software checks that you
have a working camera, microphone and tests your bandwidth. When you are ready
to perform these checks, click **Start System Check**.

Follow the instructions on each page. When you have finished performing the
system checks, you see a link for downloading the Remote Proctor Now software.

=======================================
Install the Remote Proctoring Software
=======================================

Follow the link to download the appropriate version of the Remote Proctor Now
software.

.. note:: Even if you have previously installed this software, you should
   install it again, to make sure you have the most up to date version.

Follow the instructions to install Remote Proctor Now on your computer.


=================================================
Enter Your Unique Exam Code
=================================================

When Remote Proctor Now is running on your computer, you are prompted to enter
your unique exam code.

Paste the code that you copied earlier into the Exam Code field, and select
**Validate**.

If your exam code is valid, you see the details of your exam: the exam name
and duration. Select **Next**.

.. note:: If the name of the exam is not correct WHAT DO THEY DO?

You see the Terms of Use dialog for the proctoring software. To agree to the
terms, select **I agree**.

.. note:: If you do not want to agree to the terms, select **I don't agree**.
   You can then quit the remote proctoring software, and return to the edX
   courseware where you can change your choice for the proctored exam to be
   non-proctored. ***IS this TRUE

=================================================
Pre-Exam Information
=================================================

If you have agreed to the Remote Proctor Now terms of use, you see a page of
Pre-Exam Advisory Information.

Select **Next**.

The software will detect any prohibited programs (such as Skype) and will
prompt you to close them if necessary.


=================================================
Take Photos of your Photo ID
=================================================

You need to take a picture of a photo ID that  clearly identifies you, and
that can be used to confirm your identity. Hold your card up to your webcam
and position it in the frame. Click “Take Photo”.

You’ll have a chance to preview and confirm the photo of your ID. Click
Confirm Photo ID. You can also click Retake.



=================================================
Video Scan Your Desk and Room for Proctoring
=================================================

Next, you are prompted to scan the room using your webcam so that the
proctoring software can confirm that there are no unauthorized materials on
your desk or table, under your desk or table, or in the room. Click Start Room
Scan, and pan the camera so that it captures the area on your desk, under your
desk, and pan around the room.

Click Stop Room Scan when you have finished providing a video capture of the
requested areas.

You see the Room/Desk Scan Preview. Select the checkbox to confirm, then click
“Confirm Room/Desk Scan.”

You can also click Retake or Replay

=================================================
Take a Webcam Photo of Yourself
=================================================

You are asked to take a photo of yourself using your webcam.

Click Take User Photo
There is a countdown before the camera takes the photo.

User Photo Preview

You can also click Retake User Photo

=================================================
Take the Proctored Exam
=================================================

When you have completed all the verification steps, you see a page confirming
that your proctored exam is starting. Do not close this browser dialog. Return
to the browser window where you were accessing the exam on edx.org, and take
the exam.






**********************************
Taking a Proctored Exam
**********************************

When a proctored exam starts, the time remaining is shown in a bar at the top
of the page.

You will see warnings in the timer bar when 20% of the total time is left, and
also when 5% of the total time is left.

.. note:: You can minimize the proctoring software window, but do not close it.

.. note:: If you close the edX exam browser or navigate away from your exam during your proctored exam, the timer will continue running. You cannot pause the timer. You can return to your exam at the point that you left it.

If time runs out before you have completed the exam, the proctoring review is
still submitted, and any answers that you have completed up to that time are
also submitted. If you pass the proctoring review, you might still qualify for
a passing grade with the answers you have submitted.

=============================================================
What if I experience technical difficulties during the exam?
=============================================================

If your proctoring session and timed exam end unexpectedly before you complete
the exam due to some technical difficulty, contact your course team or edX
Support and let them know about your situation. If they agree that there is a
legitimate reason, you might be able to try again to take the proctored exam.
Your answers from any failed attempt are not kept.

- Loss of internet connectivity.
- Computer shut down or became unresponsive.
- Accidentally closed the proctoring software window.
- Accidentally closed the edX.org exam window.








**********************************
Completing a Proctored Exam
**********************************

When you submit your responses to a proctored exam before time expires, there
are two processes for evaluating whether you have earned credit for the exam.

#. Software Secure 

Close the Remote Proctor Now window. After you have quit Remote Proctor Now,
the exam data upload starts.

When the proctoring session data has finished uploading, your proctoring
review status is in a "Pending" state. It might take 3-5 days for your
proctoring session to be reviewed. When the review is complete, you will be
able to see whether your result is Pass or Fail.

.. note:: Your proctoring session review result is separate from the score you
   achieve on your exam. It is possible for you to receive a Pass on the proctoring review, but not earn enough points to qualify for a passing grade on the exam. Conversely, you might receive a passing grade on the exam questions, but you might fail the proctoring review. 

   Any Fail result on the proctoring review means that you cannot apply for
   credit for the course, regardless of the grade you achieved in the exam or
   in the course.

You have the option to apply for credit if:
- you have completed the required exams
- you have a grade that is deemed sufficient to earn credit
- you have passed proctoring reviews for the relevant exams.
