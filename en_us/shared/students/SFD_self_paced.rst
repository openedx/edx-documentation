Taking a Self-Paced Course
###########################

Many courses are instructor-paced: they follow a schedule that the instructor
sets, with assignments and exams that have specific due dates. In contrast,
self-paced courses allow you to progress through the course at your own speed.

    On the edx.org home page, an indication next to the course start date lets
    you know if a course is self-paced.

************************************************************
Differences between Instructor- and Self-Paced Courses
************************************************************

Instructor-paced courses follow a set schedule. Course materials become
available at specific times as the course progresses. Assignments have due
dates, and exams have start and end dates. On the **Course** page, indicators
show when you have a graded assignment, as well as the due date for the
assignment.

Self-paced courses do not follow a set schedule. Course materials do not become
available according to a schedule, but are completely available as soon as the
course begins. Assignments and exams do not have start or due dates. The course
shows indicators for graded assignments, but not due dates.

In self-paced courses, you can submit an assignment or exam at any time before
the course end date.
