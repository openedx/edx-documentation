Starting a Course
********************

This section describes how to start a course and begin doing course work, and
how to change settings that apply to a specific course.

As soon as you enroll in a course, you can access some information about the
course and change course-specific settings on your :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner
Dashboard>`. If the course start date has not passed, you cannot access course
lessons or assignments.

.. _Start Date and Duration:

===========================
Find a Course's Start Date
===========================

Often, you can enroll in a course before it actually starts. You can find the
course start date on your dashboard; however, the exact time is not published.

* You do not need to sign in exactly when the course begins.

* If the course content is not immediately available, check back later on the
  start date.

To find the course start date, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select the dropdown menu icon next to your
   username.

#. Select **Dashboard**. Your dashboard lists every course that you are
   enrolled in.

#. Locate the course in the list of courses on your dashboard.

   * For courses that have not yet started, "Starts" and the date appear
     below the name of the course.

   * For courses that are already in progress, "Started" and the date appear.

   * If the course team has not yet announced the start date, a message such as
     "Coming Soon" appears.

   * For archived courses that are no longer running, "Ended" and
     the date appear.


===============
Start a Course
===============

To start work in a course that is in progress, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Course**. The course **Home** page opens. This page shows
   important dates and, typically, a welcome message from the course team.

#. Select **Course**. The first section of course content opens.

==============================
View an Archived Course
==============================

You can enroll or continue to work in some courses even after the course end
date. These courses are archived, which means that while you can access the
course content, you cannot submit answers for graded problems or participate in
course discussions.

To view the content of an archived course, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Archived Course**.

======================
View a Course Grade
======================

To view your current grade in a course that has not yet ended, see :ref:`SFD
Check Progress`.

To view your final grade in a course that you have completed, follow these
steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course. Your final grade appears under the
   course name.

#. Optionally, print your dashboard to obtain a record of your achievement in
   the course.

You can also view the course and open its **Progress** page to view your final
grade, as well as your grades on all course assignments.

========================
View Certificate Status
========================

If you are enrolled in a certificate track for your course, updates on the
status of your certificate, and options for accessing earned certificates, are
available in the course card on your dashboard.

For example, if you have earned a certificate and the course team has
generated certificates for the course, you can use the **View Certificate**
option to access your web certificate.
