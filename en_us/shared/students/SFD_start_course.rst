********************
Starting a Course
********************

This section describes how to start a course and begin doing course work, and
how to change settings that apply to a specific course.

As soon as you enroll in a course, you can access some information about the
course and change course-specific settings on your :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner
Dashboard>`. If the course start date has not passed, you cannot access course
lessons or assignments.

.. _Start Date and Duration:

===========================
Find a Course's Start Date
===========================

You can usually enroll in a course before the start date, although you cannot
access course materials and complete assignments.

You can find a course's start date on its About page. Not all courses publish
the exact start time.

If you have enrolled in a course, the course is added to the list of courses on
your :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner Dashboard>`. You can find the start date on the
course listing on your dashboard.

* You do not need to sign in exactly when the course begins.

* If the course content is not immediately available, check back later on the
  start date.

For more information about different course statuses, see :ref:`Course
Availability`

===============
Start a Course
===============

To start work in a course that is in progress, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Course**. The course **Home** page opens. This page shows
   important dates and, typically, a welcome message from the course team.

#. Select **Course**. The first section of course content opens.

==============================
View an Archived Course
==============================

You can enroll or continue to work in some courses even after the course end
date. These courses are archived, which means that while you can access the
course content, you cannot submit answers for graded problems or participate in
course discussions.

To view the content of an archived course, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Archived Course**.

======================
View a Course Grade
======================

To view your current grade in a course that has not yet ended, see :ref:`SFD
Check Progress`.

To view your final grade in a course that you have completed, follow these
steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course. Your final grade appears under the
   course name.

#. Optionally, print your dashboard to obtain a record of your achievement in
   the course.

You can also view the course and open its **Progress** page to view your final
grade, as well as your grades on all course assignments.

========================
View Certificate Status
========================

If you are enrolled in a certificate track for your course, updates on the
status of your certificate, and options for accessing earned certificates, are
available in the course card on your dashboard.

For example, if you have earned a certificate and the course team has
generated certificates for the course, you can use the **View Certificate**
option to access your web certificate.
