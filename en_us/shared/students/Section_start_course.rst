Find a Course's Start Date
===========================

Often, you can enroll in a course before it actually starts. You can find the
course start date on your dashboard; however, the exact time is not published.

* You do not need to sign in exactly when the course begins.

* If the course content is not immediately available, check back later on the
  start date.

To find the course start date, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select the dropdown menu icon next to your
   username.

#. Select **Dashboard**. Your dashboard lists every course that you are
   enrolled in.

#. Locate the course in the list of courses on your dashboard.

   * For courses that have not yet started, "Starts" and the date appear
     below the name of the course.

   * For courses that are already in progress, "Started" and the date appear.

   * If the course team has not yet announced the start date, a message such as
     "Coming Soon" appears.

   * For archived courses that are no longer running, "Ended" and
     the date appear.
