As you read the contributions that other learners and course team members make
to discussion topics, you can provide feedback in other ways than writing a
complete response or comment.

 :alt: The "Vote", "Follow", and "More" feedback icons in a post, response, or
    comment.

Select the "More" icon to show a menu of additional options. Options vary
depending on whether the contribution is a post, response, or comment, and on
whether you are a learner in the course, or a member of the discussion
moderation team.


.. _Vote for Posts or Responses:

************************************
Vote for Posts or Responses
************************************

To provide positive feedback for a post or one of its responses, you can vote
for it. Open the post or response, and select the plus sign (+) icon next to the
number of **Votes**. You can only vote for posts added by other discussion
participants. You cannot vote for your own posts.

In the discussion navigation pane, you can sort the list of posts so that the
posts with the most votes appear at the top. To do this, select the drop-down
list of sorting options and select **by most votes**. For more information
about ways to sort the list of discussion topics, see :ref:`Read New or
Updated Posts`.


.. _Follow Posts:

************************************
Follow Posts
************************************

If you find a conversation or question particularly interesting, you can
follow it so that you can return to it easily.

To follow a post, move your cursor over the star icon for the post, and then
select **Follow**.

Each post that you follow appears with a "Following" indicator in the list of
posts.

In the discussion navigation pane, you can list only the posts that you are
following, regardless of the discussion topic they apply to. To do this,
select **All Topics** and then select **Posts I'm Following**.


.. _Answer Questions:

********************************************************
Answer Questions and Mark Questions as Answered
********************************************************

Anyone in a course can answer questions that are posted in the course
discussions. To respond to a question that has been asked by someone else in
the course, add a response with your answer to the question post.

If you have received a helpful or correct response to a question that you
yourself have asked, you can mark the response as the correct answer. To do
this, move your cursor over the check mark icon for the response, and then
select **Mark as Answer**.

.. note:: The discussion moderation team can mark any response as correct.
   Learners can only mark responses as correct for their own posts.

After at least one response to a question post is marked as a correct answer, a
check mark icon replaces the post's question mark indicator in the discussion
navigation pane.


.. _Report Discussion Misuse:

************************************
Report Discussion Misuse
************************************

On rare occasions you might come across a discussion contribution that is
inappropriate. You can flag any post, response, or comment for a discussion
moderator to review. To do so, open the contribution, select **More**, and then
select **Report**.

The discussion moderation team can investigate any flagged posts, responses,
or comments and take the appropriate action.

.. note:: Only the person who flagged a contribution and the discussion
   moderation team can see that a contribution has been reported.
