Exploring Discussion Posts
###########################

This topic describes how to explore discussion posts in your edX course.

*********
Overview
*********

Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the subject that interests you, and then
reading and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps
make the time that everyone spends with the course discussions more productive.
You can search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a
single discussion topic.

.. _Search Discussions:

******************************
Search the Discussions
******************************

To search for text, select **All Discussions** and enter a phrase, a word, or
part of a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When
you press Enter, the search tries to find:

* A match or close match to your text in any post, response, or comment. The
  display updates to show a list of the posts that have a match at any level of
  interaction.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message appears above the posts that have similar text at any interaction
  level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option appears above any posts that have an exact text match at
  any interaction level. Select the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments. For more information about viewing
  contributions from a specific user, see :ref:`View from Participant`.

.. _Discussion Topics:

*********************************************
View Discussions about a Specific Topic
*********************************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. When a
participant creates a post, the participant selects a topic from a list of
topics that the course team has provided. You can look through topics in the
discussions to find one that interests you.

Discussion topics for edX courses can be *course-wide* or *content-specific*.

* Course-wide discussion topics cover matters that affect the entire course,
  and can include topics such as "Frequently Asked Questions" and
  "Troubleshooting".

* Content-specific discussion topics cover specific video lectures, reading
  assignments, homework problems, or other course content.

=======================================
View Topics on the Discussion Page
=======================================

On the **Discussion** page, you can view both course-wide and content-specific
discussions. Select **All Discussions** in the upper left corner of the left
pane to see all discussion topics in the course. To see all the discussions in
an individual topic, select the topic name.

Note that course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them,
while content-specific topics are indented under a category name. For content-
specific topics, you can select either the category name to see all the posts
in that category, or you can select an individual topic name.

=======================================
View Topics in a Course Unit
=======================================

Content-specific topics are located in specific units in the course. They
typically appear below the content they apply to.

You can access a content-specific topic by viewing the unit that
contains the topic. To see the discussion, select **Show Discussion**.

where that topic is located.

View Only Unread or Unanswered Posts
*****************************************

To limit the posts shown on the **Discussion** page, you can select one of the
filter options. Above the list of posts, the **Show all** filter is selected by
default.

* To list only the discussions and questions that you have not yet viewed,
  select **Unread**.

* To list only question posts that do not yet have any responses marked as
  answers, select **Unanswered**.

*****************************************
View Pinned Posts
*****************************************

Pinned posts appear at the top of the list of posts when you view all
discussions. Pinned posts can contain important information about the course or
any part of the course, such as a particular video or problem. The pinned post
may originate from anyone in the course, including students and the discussion
moderation team, but only members of the moderation team can pin posts.

.. _View from Participant:

*************************************************
View Contributions from a Specific Participant
*************************************************

You can review all the posts, responses, and comments that a specific
participant has made. You can select other learners, or members of the course
team. To do this, select the username that appears at the top of any of the
participant's contributions. A page opens that shows the following information
about the participant.

* The participant's username.

* The participant's role (for example, student or community TA).

* The number of posts the participant has created (listed in the upper-left
  corner as the number of discussions started).

* The total number of responses and comments the participant has added to other
  posts (listed in the upper-left corner as the number of comments).

* A list of all the posts that contain a contribution from the participant,
  whether the participant created the original post or contributed a response
  or comment to a different post. The list of posts includes the title of the
  post and the username of the participant who created the post. To see the
  comments or responses on any post, select **View Discussion** below the post
  to open the discussion on the **Discussion** page.
