.. _Add a Post:

**************
Adding a Post
**************

When you add a post to a discussion in your course, you decide what type of
post to make and the topic of the post. For course-wide discussion topics, you
can add a post on the **Discussion** page. For content-specific discussions in
a course unit, you can add a post either on the **Discussion** page or
directly in the course unit.

.. _Determine Post Type:

**************************************************
Determining the Post Type: Discussion or Question
**************************************************

To make sure that other learners and the course team can find and respond to
your post, decide what type of post you want to make: either question or
discussion.

* A question post raises an issue so that the discussion moderation team or
  community can provide answers.

* A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and
  reflections, and inviting community participation.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion). If you are asking a question about the
course and need an answer from the course team, be sure to create your post as
a question, so that the course team sees that a response is required and
responds appropriately.

After you make your post, on the **Discussion** page for your course, a
question mark image identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation
bubble image identifies posts that start discussions.

.. note:: You can change the post type from discussion to question or vice
   versa at any time after you add your post. For more information, see
   :ref:`Edit or Delete`.


.. _Determine Post Topic:

****************************
Determining the Post Topic
****************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. The course team
creates the list of discussion topics for each course, and you choose a
topic from that list when you create your post. Before you add a post, you
should look through the list of topics in the course discussions so that you
can decide which topic is the most appropriate for your post. For more
information, see :ref:`Explore Posts`.

After you decide on a post type and topic, you can add your post on the
**Discussion** page or in the body of the course.


.. _Add a post on discussion page:

************************************
Add a Post on the Discussion Page
************************************

You can add a post for course-wide or content-specific discussion
topics on the **Discussion** page.

#. On the **Discussion** page, select **Add a Post**.

#. Determine the type of post you want to make, and select **Question** or
   **Discussion**.

#. Determine the most appropriate topic for adding your post to, and select the
   topic from the **Topic Area** list.

#. In the **Title** box, enter a short, descriptive title. The title is the
   part of your post that others see when they are browsing on the
   **Discussion** page or scrolling through one of the content-specific topics.

#. Enter the text of your post. To format the text or to add links or
   images, use the formatting options above the text box.

   Any text formatting or images that you add are only visible when others
   read your post in a web browser. The edX mobile app currently does
   not display added formatting or images.

   .. note:: If you include an image with your post, include a description so
      that learners who use screen readers to access the course can understand
      the image's content and purpose. The description also displays in place
      of the image if problems occur with the image file. If the image has no
      functional purpose, leave the **Description** field empty and select
      **This image is for decorative purposes only and does not require a
      description**.

      The maximum size for an uploaded file is 1 MB.

In some courses, you can add posts, responses, and comments anonymously. If
this is the case, a **Post Anonymously** option is available under the field
where you enter your text. When you post anonymously, the discussion
moderation team can see your username, but other learners cannot.


************************************
Add a Post in a Course Unit
************************************

If you come to a discussion as you work through the units in your course, or
if you know where in the course a particular discussion originates, you can
add a post for that discussion from the unit in your course.

The following steps apply only to content-specific discussions.

#. Select **Course**.

#. Open the unit in the course that includes the discussion topic that you
   want to add a post to.

#. Select **Show Discussion** to read what others have already contributed to
   the conversation.

   The title and the first line of each post is shown in the list of posts.

   To read an entire post and view its responses and comments, select any part
   of the post preview.

#. To contribute a new post to the discussion, select **Add a Post** and follow
   the steps that you use to add a post to the discussion page. For more
   information, see :ref:`Add a post on discussion page`.

   To respond to an existing post or comment on an existing response, follow
   the steps described in :ref:`Add Response`.

.. note:: In some courses, you can add posts, responses, and comments
   anonymously. If this is the case, a **Post Anonymously** option is
   available under the field where you enter your text. When you post
   anonymously, the discussion moderation team can see your username, but
   other learners cannot.


.. _Add Response:
