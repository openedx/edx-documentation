The edX Video Player
#####################

All edX courses include videos, and edX has its own video player. Most of the
controls on the player will be familiar to you if you have watched online
videos before. However, the edX video player has some extra features you may
not have seen.

The following image shows the video player in the middle of a video, followed
by an explanation of each option or control on the video player.

1. **Play/pause control**: You can play or pause the video by using this
   control.

2. **Time**: The first number indicates the time the video has played. The
   second number indicates the total length of the video.

3. **Time slider**: You can drag this control to any point in the video if you
   want to go back or skip ahead to a particular time.

4. **Speed control**: If you want the video to play faster or slower, you can
   select different speeds using this control.

5. **Volume control**: You can use this control to change the volume of the
   video.

6. **Full screen control**: You can expand the video to fill your browser
   window by selecting this control. To return to default mode, press ESC on
   your keyboard.

7. **HD control**: Some videos have a high-definition option that you can use
   if you have a fast internet connection. You only see this control if your
   video has a high-definition option.

8. **Show transcript control**: You can show or hide the scrolling transcript
   to the right of the video by selecting this control.

9. **Download video option**: This option allows you to download the video to
   watch later. You only see this option if the video is available for
   download.

10. **Download transcript option**: This option allows you to download a copy
    of the video's transcript. You can download the transcript as a SubRip
    (.srt) file or as a text (.txt) file. You can open files of both types in a
    text editor such as Notepad. You only see this option if the transcript is
    available for download.

11. **Transcript**: The transcript for the video plays by default when your
    video starts. You can scroll through the transcript and select any word to
    go to that point in the video.

12. **License**: If the course author has specified a license for the video
    that is different than the course-wide license, license details appear at
    the bottom of the video. For licenses that reserve some but not all rights,
    you can select the license to open a web site with more information about
    your rights. For more information, see :ref:`Course and Video Licenses`.

For a demonstration of the edX video player, see `Videos on edX`_ in the edX
