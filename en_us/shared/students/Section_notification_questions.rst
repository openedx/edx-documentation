.. _Notification Questions:

=========================================================
Will I get notified about upcoming due dates and exams?
=========================================================

Many course teams send notifications to remind you when assignments are due
or make other announcements. However, each course team decides what to
announce and when, and whether to send notifications to the mobile app.

========================================================
Where can I read all of the announcements for my course?
========================================================

You can use the edX mobile app or a web browser to visit the **Home**
page and read all of the announcements.

==================================================================
How do I turn off course notifications (or turn them back on)?
==================================================================

You can turn notifications off, or on, for each of your courses. In the edX
mobile app, select the course and visit its **Home** page to change the
notification setting.

===========================================================
Can I turn off notifications for all of my courses at once?
===========================================================

You can turn off all notifications for the edX mobile app. To change the
notification setting on an Android smartphone, visit the **App info** page for
the edX mobile app. On an iPhone, visit **Settings** and then select the edX
mobile app.
