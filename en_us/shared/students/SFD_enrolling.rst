##############################


To enroll in a course, follow these steps.

#. On the edX home page, select the course that you want.
#. When the About page for the course opens, select **Enroll Now** in the
   upper right corner of the page.

  * If your course only offers honor code certificates, you are enrolled in
    the course after you select **Enroll Now**.

  * If your course offers both honor code certificates and verified
    certificates, you must select the type of certificate you want after you
    select **Enroll Now**.

    * To work toward an honor code certificate, select **Audit This
      Course**.

    * To work toward a verified certificate, select **Pursue a Verified
      Certificate**, and then follow the onscreen instructions to pay the
      course fee and verify your identity. You must pay the course fee
      before you can begin the course. You do not have to verify your
      identity immediately, but you must verify your identity before the
      course ID verification deadline has passed. For more information, see
      :ref:`SFD Verify Your Identity`.

     For more information about honor code certificates and verified

   list of courses.

If you select **View Course** on your dashboard, the **Course Info** page for
the course opens. If the course has already started, you can select the
**Courseware** page to access released course materials.

.. _SFD Verify Your Identity:

******************************
Verify Your Identity
******************************

When you enroll in the verified certificate track for a course, you do not
have to verify your identity immediately, but you must verify your identity
before the course ID verification deadline. You can see the deadline below the
name of the course on your dashboard.

To verify your identity, you use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of
a government-issued photo ID to edX's authorization service. We encrypt your
photos and use the highest levels of security available to protect your data.
If your computer does not have a webcam, you must verify your identity on a
computer that does have a webcam.

When you verify your identity for one course, you verify your identity for all
edX courses. Verification is effective for one year. If you enroll in another
verified course within that year, you do not have to verify your identity.

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

.. note:: You must have a webcam and a government-issued photo ID to 
 verify your identity.

#. Start the verification process by completing one of the following actions.

   * If you have not yet enrolled in the course, select **Pursue a Verified
     Certificate**, submit payment information, and then select **Verify Now**
     on the payment confirmation page.

   * If you enrolled in the course as an honor code learner, select **Upgrade
     to Verified Track** next to the course on your dashboard.

   * If you enrolled as a verified learner and submitted payment but did not
     verify your identity, select **Verify Now** next to the course
     on your dashboard.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon below your image to
   take a picture of your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines to the right of your image.

#. Review your photo. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake
   Photo**. When you are satisfied with your photo, select **Next: Take a
   photo of your ID** in the lower right corner.

#. On the **Take a Photo of Your ID** page, hold your government-issued photo
   ID up to the webcam on your computer. Make sure the ID in the image is
   legible, and then select the camera icon below the image box to take a
   photo of your ID.

#. Review your photo. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake
   Photo**. When you are satisfied with your photo, select **Next: Review Your
   Info** in the lower right corner.

#. On the **Review Your Photos** page, review the photo of your face and of
   your ID. Make sure that the photos meet the requirements listed under
   **Photo requirements**, and then select **Confirm** in the lower right
   corner.

   .. note:: If your ID uses non-Roman characters, you must enter a full 
    name for your edX account in this step so that it also uses non-Roman
    characters to match your ID. To do this, select **Edit Your Name** in the
    list of requirements, and then enter your name in non-Roman characters in
    the text box.

        characters and a callout indicating where the learner enters his full
        name.

A verification confirmation page opens and confirms that you have submitted
your ID verification photos.

After edX's authorization service examines your photo, you receive a message
on your dashboard that informs you whether the verification process was
successful. If the verification process was not successful, you must submit
new verification photos. You can begin the verification process again by
selecting **Verify Your Identity**.
