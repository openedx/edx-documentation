Certificates
##############################

Nearly every course on edx.org offers a certificate when you complete the
course successfully. The certificate includes your name, the name of the
course, the edX partner university that created the course, and the names of
one or more members of the course team. The certificate also lists a URL that
viewers can use to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

Because edX courses are not credit-bearing courses, the certificate doesn't
include a grade or specify the number of credit hours that the course might
earn in a university. Additionally, transcripts are not available for edX
course work.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then select **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

****************************
Selecting a Certificate Type
****************************

Three types of certificates may be available for courses on edx.org: honor
code, verified, and XSeries. You select the certificate type you want when you
register for a course.

Honor code and verified certificates show that you've completed a single honor
code or verified course. An XSeries certificate shows that you've completed a
series of courses, known as an XSeries.

The type of certificate appears in a color-coded tag under the course image on
your dashboard:

.. note:: A very small number of courses do not offer certificates. These courses 
  have the same rigorous material as other edX courses. If you want evidence
  that you completed the course, you can print a copy of the **Progress** page
  in the course.

.. _SFD Honor Code Certificates:

=========================
Honor Code Certificates
=========================

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available
for all except a few specific courses. When you audit a course, or you take a
course that doesn't offer verified certificates, you'll automatically receive
an honor code certificate if you meet the requirements to pass the course.

.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

=========================
Verified Certificates
=========================

Some edX courses offer verified certificates. A verified certificate shows not
only that you successfully completed your edX course, but also that you've
verified your identity by using a webcam and an official ID from your country
or region. You may want to work toward a verified certificate if you plan to
use your course for job applications, promotions, or school applications.

If a course offers verified certificates, you see a "Verified" badge on the
course image in the list of courses on edx.org.

For a list of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX
course catalog <https://www.edx.org/course-
list/allschools/verified/allcourses>`_.

Verified certificates are available for a fee that varies by course. The fee
helps support edX. If you want to donate to edX, you can choose to pay more
than the minimum required fee. For more information about the fee for a
particular course, see the About page for that course.

When you enroll in the verified certificate track for a course, you must
submit a payment before you can see course content. You do not have to verify
your identity at that time. However, you must verify your identity before the
deadline for verification in that course. For more information, see :ref:`SFD
Verify Your Identity`.

.. note:: When you verify your identity for one course, you verify your 
 identity for all edX courses. Verification is effective for one year. If
 you enroll in another verified course within that year, you do not have to
 verify your identity.

If you have a question or an issue with billing for a verified certificate,
contact us at `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. Include your
order number, but please **do not include your credit card information**.

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you've successfully earned a verified certificate
for each course in a series of courses that make up an XSeries.

****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You may register for one type of certificate but later decide that you want a
different type of certificate. For example, you may register for an honor code
certificate, but you might later want to change to a verified certificate. You
can change the certificate type until registration for verified certificates
ends for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course starts.

* To upgrade to a verified certificate, go to your dashboard, and then select
  **Challenge Yourself!** under the name of your course. You then follow
  the onscreen instructions to register for a verified certificate.

  If registration for verified certificates has closed, you cannot change your
  certificate type. Registration for verified certificates typically closes
  two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one assignment due
  date has passed.

* To change from a verified certificate to an honor code certificate, go to
  your dashboard, and then select **Unregister** under the name of your
  course. The edX support team will contact you with information about a
  refund. You must change to an honor code certificate before verified
  certificate registration closes for your course if you want to receive a
  refund.

  If you do not see the **Unregister** button, registration for verified
  certificates has closed. Registration for verified certificates typically
  closes two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one
  assignment due date has passed.

If you have questions about changing your certificate type, you can contact
the edX support team at `technical@edx.org <mailto://technical@edx.org>`_.

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends--usually within two
weeks. After the course ends, you'll see the following message under the course
name on your dashboard:

::

  Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
  will be available shortly.

When your certificate is ready, your dashboard will show you your final grade
for the class as well as a link to your certificate.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_DownloadButton.png

   :alt: Dashboard with course name, grade, and link to certificate

If you want a paper copy of your certificate, you can select **Download Your
Certificate (PDF)** to download and print the certificate from your dashboard.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then select **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

=============================================
Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
=============================================

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through the
courseware at your own pace.

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you've completed all course
assignments and the final exam (if applicable), a certificate is generated
automatically. You don't have to complete any additional steps to obtain your
certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others
issue certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
specific certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Course Info** tab
for your course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates: 

On-Demand Certificates
*********************************

A few self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to request and download your certificate as soon as you complete
enough of the course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out
if a course offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_QualifiedOnDemand.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Image of the top of a Progress page, with the text "Congratulations,
      you've qualified for a certificate!"

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate. Note, however, that if you request your certificate before the
end of the course, the grade that you see on your dashboard no longer updates
automatically as you complete coursework. Your **Progress** page continues to
reflect your current grade. To update your grade on your dashboard, request
your certificate again.

.. note:: Your course grade does not appear on your certificate.


.. _Request Download Certificate:

Request and Download a Certificate
