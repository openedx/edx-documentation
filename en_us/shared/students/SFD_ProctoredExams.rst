****************************
Proctored Exams Overview
****************************

If you are taking a course for credit as a Verified track student, it is
important that edX can make sure that you took and passed required exams in the
course without cheating or using a false identity. Proctored exams use
software to check that the person taking the exam is the same person who is
taking the course for credit, and also to detect any attempts to cheat on the
exam.

If an exam in your course is marked as a proctored exam, you can choose to
take the exam without proctoring, but you will not be eligible for credit for
it.

If you take an exam as a proctored exam, you must pass the proctoring review,
otherwise you cannot earn credit for your course even if you have attained a
passing grade.

If you are not ready to take the exam right now, you can return to it and make
your choice later, although you should give yourself enough time to take it
before the due date.


****************************
How Proctored Exams Work
****************************

When you agree to take a proctored exam, you agree to install remote
proctoring software, perform various identification and environment checks,
and allow the software to record video and sounds while you take the exam.

=======================================
Choose to take a Proctored Exam
=======================================

After you choose proctoring, you see a page with a unique exam code. The code
is unique to your edX account and to this exam; do not share it. It can only
be used once. You will be asked for this code during the proctoring set up.
Copy this code so that you can paste it when you are prompted to do so.

=======================================
Perform the System Checks
=======================================

The Remote Proctor Now system check window opens. The software checks that you
have a working camera, microphone and tests your bandwidth. When you are ready
to perform these checks, click **Start System Check**.

Follow the instructions on each page. When you have finished performing the
system checks, you see a link for downloading the Remote Proctor Now software.

=======================================
Install the Remote Proctoring Software
=======================================

Follow the link to download the appropriate version of the Remote Proctor Now
software.

.. note:: Even if you have previously installed this software, you should
   install it again, to make sure you have the most up to date version.

Follow the instructions to install Remote Proctor Now on your computer.


=================================================
Enter Your Unique Exam Code
=================================================

When Remote Proctor Now is running on your computer, you are prompted to enter
your unique exam code.

Paste the code that you copied earlier into the Exam Code field, and select
**Validate**.

If your exam code is valid, you see the details of your exam: the exam name
and duration. Select **Next**.

.. note:: If the name of the exam is not correct WHAT DO THEY DO?

You see the Terms of Use dialog for the proctoring software. To agree to the
terms, select **I agree**.

.. note:: If you do not want to agree to the terms, select **I don't agree**.
   You can then quit the remote proctoring software, and return to the edX
   courseware where you can change your choice for the proctored exam to be
   non-proctored. ***IS this TRUE

=================================================
Pre-Exam Information
=================================================

If you have agreed to the Remote Proctor Now terms of use, you see a page of
Pre-Exam Advisory Information.

Select **Next**.

The software will detect any prohibited programs (such as Skype) and will
prompt you to close them if necessary.

=================================================
Video Scan Your Desk and Room for Proctoring

proctoring software can confirm that there are no unauthorized materials on
your desk or table, under your desk or table, or in the room. Click Start Room
Scan, and pan the camera so that it captures the area on your desk, under your
desk, and pan around the room.
