********************************************************
Overview of Mathematical and Scientific Expressions
********************************************************

For some math, science, and other problems, you must enter a numerical or math
expression, such as a formula, into a response field. You enter your response
as plain text, and the edX system then converts your text into numbers and
symbols that appear below the response field.

Additionally, some edX courses offer a calculator tool that you can use while
you work through the course. If the course has a calculator, the calculator
appears as a small icon on all courseware pages.

To use the calculator, select the calculator icon. To close the calculator,
select the X.

Entering Math Expressions
****************************

Both the calculator and the response fields in math problems accept a
selection of characters that represent numbers, operators, constants,
functions, and other mathematical concepts. You might recognize parts of this
system if you have used math programs before.

.. note::
  The calculator includes an information page that shows an abbreviated version
  of the information in this topic. To see the information page, select the
  circled ``i`` icon next to the input field.

When you enter your plain text into the calculator or the response field,
follow these guidelines.

* **Arithmetical operations**: Use standard characters for addition (+),
  subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
  
  * **Multiplication**: Be sure to indicate multiplication explicitly. That is,
    instead of ``mc^2`` type ``m*c^2``, and instead of ``5a+4b+3c`` type
    ``5*a+4*b+3*c``.
    
* **Operation order**: Use parentheses (``( )``) to specify the order of
  operations and to make your expression as clear as possible. Use curved
  parentheses (``( )``) only. Do not use brackets (``[ ]``) or braces (``{
  }``).

* **Exponents or superscripts**: Insert a caret (^) before an exponent or
  superscript. If the exponent or superscript includes multiple characters or
  is an expression, surround the expression with parentheses. For example, you
  can enter ``x^n`` or ``x^(n-1)``.

* **Subscripts**: Insert an underscore (_) before a subscript to indicate a
  subscript. If the subscript has multiple characters, type the characters
  without a space. For example, you can enter ``v_IN-v_OUT``. Note, however,
  that subscripts cannot currently include operators or parentheses.

* Avoid whitespace.

* Don't use equal signs (=).

* Because the system is case-sensitive, make sure you use uppercase and
  lowercase letters carefully.

For more information about the types of characters you can use, see below.

.. note:: The edX system accepts both constants and metric affixes. Be 
  careful to distinguish between constants and metric affixes. Constants stand
  alone, while metric affixes must be combined with numbers.

  For example, ``c`` can be a constant representing the speed of light or a
  metric affix meaning "centi". When you use ``c`` as a metric affix, don't
  include a space between ``c`` and the number. When you use ``c`` as a
  constant, indicate multiplication explicitly. The following examples show the
  difference:

  * ``2c`` = ``0.02`` (2 multiplied by 0.01)
  * ``2*c`` = ``599584916.0`` (the speed of light multiplied by 2)

  * ``2M`` = ``2,000,000`` (2 multiplied by 1,000,000)
  * ``2*M`` = 2 multiplied by the variable M

  For more information, see :ref:`Scientific Notation` or :ref:`Constants`.

============
Numbers
============

You can use the following types of numbers:

* Integers: 2520
* Fractions: 2/3
* Normal floats: 3.14
* Floats with no integer part: .98

The largest number you can use is **1.7977e+308**, which is the largest float
possible in the Python programming language. 

.. _Scientific Notation:

======================================
Scientific Notation and Metric Affixes
======================================

You can enter metric affixes or scientific notation to indicate very large or
very small numbers. For scientific notation, you can type either a caret (^) or
the letter ``e`` followed by a number to indicate an exponent. You can use both
positive and negative exponents.

For example, to indicate ``0.012``, you can enter either of the following
expressions:

* ``1.2^-2``
* ``1.2e-2``

To indicate ``-440,000``, you can enter either of the following expressions:

* ``-4.4^5``
* ``-4.4e5``

The following table shows how to enter numbers with metric affixes, with
scientific notation, and with ``e`` notation.

.. note:: When you use metric affixes or ``e`` notation, make sure you do not 
  include spaces between the number and the metric affix or the ``e``.

.. _Constants:

============
Constants
============

You can use several different constants in your mathematical expressions.

.. note:: When you enter constants multiplied by a number, make sure to 
  indicate the multiplication explicitly. For example, enter ``2*c`` instead of
  ``2c`` and ``-4*i`` instead of ``-4i``.

.. Should I include another example in the note?

calculator or the response field.

     - 
     - 

.. note:: ``epsilon`` is the lunate version, whereas ``varepsilon`` looks 
  like a backward 3.


============
Functions
============

To use a function, type the letters that represent the function, and then
surround the expression in that function with parentheses. For example, to
represent the square root of ``4*a+b``, type ``sqrt(4*a+b)``.

You can use the following functions:

* Common functions 

  * sqrt
  * log10
  * log2
  * ln
  * exp
  * abs

* Trigonometric functions and their inverses

  * sin 
  * cos
  * tan
  * sec
  * csc
  * cot
  * arcsin
  * arccos
  * arctan
  * arcsec
  * arccsc
  * arccot

* Hyperbolic trigonometric functions and their inverses

  * sinh
  * cosh
  * tanh
  * sech
  * csch
  * coth
  * arcsinh
  * arccosh
  * arctanh
  * arcsech
  * arccsch
  * arccoth

* Factorials: Enter factorials as ``fact(3)`` or ``factorial(3)``. You must use
  integers. For example, you can't enter ``fact(1.5)``.

* A "parallel resistors" operator (``||``). For example, ``1 || 2`` represents
  the resistance of a pair of parallel resistors (of resistance 1 and 2 ohms),
  evaluating to 2/3 (ohms).
