In some edX courses, you can use the Student Notes feature to highlight and make
notes about what you read right in the body of the course. You can see
individual notes inside the course content, or you can see all of your notes at
once on the **Notes** tab.

.. note:: You can create notes for most text in the body of the course. 
 However, the student notes feature is currently not available for exercises,
 videos, or PDF textbooks.

***************************
Using Student Notes
***************************

When a course includes student notes, every page has a **Notes** tab at the top
and a pencil icon in the lower-right corner.

The **Notes** tab lists all the notes that you have made during the course.
For more information, see :ref:`The Notes Tab`.

.. note:: Learners who do not use a mouse can use keyboard shortcuts to create, 
 access, and delete notes. For more information about using keyboard
 shortcuts, see :ref:`SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts`.

   many characters and words as you want.

*********************************************
Keyboard Shortcuts for Student Notes
*********************************************

You can use keyboard shortcuts to create, edit, and delete your notes.

 However, you can only use these keyboard shortcuts on browsers that support
 caret browsing.

    caret browsing in Firefox, press F7.

    information about VoiceOver, see the `Apple website
    <https://www.apple.com/accessibility/osx/voiceover/>`_.

Before you use the following keyboard shortcuts, you must make sure that notes
are turned on. To turn notes on or off, press Ctrl + Shift + left bracket
(``[``). Notes are turned on when a pencil icon with a dark gray background is
visible in the lower-right corner of the page. If the pencil icon has a light
gray background, notes are turned off. In the following image, notes are
turned on.
