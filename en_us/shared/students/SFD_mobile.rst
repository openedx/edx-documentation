The edX Mobile App
########################

The edX mobile app is a companion to the `edx.org`_ website. You can use the
app to download course videos so that you can watch them whenever you want to,
even without an Internet connection. To access the rest of the course,
including course discussions, homework, and quizzes, you use a web
browser on a computer.

The edX mobile app is currently available for Android smartphones and iPhones.

Courseware Questions
*************************

========================================================
Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?
========================================================

Not at this time. With the edX mobile app, you can download course videos to
watch when you do not have an Internet connection. To complete other work,
including readings, homework problems, and exams, use a computer.

========================================================

========================================================

read or contribute to the discussions, use a computer.

*************************
Video Questions
*************************

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, select the "download" icon that appears to the right of each
section, subsection, or video name. 

* If you select download for a section or subsection, you download all of the
  videos in that section or subsection.
* If you select download for a video, you download only that video.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_DownloadIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the "download" icon circled.

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download
a video, you can watch it any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading any
video can result in heavy data use. We recommend using a Wi-Fi connection if you
intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX app has a **Download only
on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid using your
cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of section and subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a section or subsection name is the number of videos
in that section or subsection.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_NumberVideos.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the number of videos circled.

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video name?
========================================================

The circle indicates whether you have already played a video. A blue circle
means that you have not started playing the video. A half-filled circle means
that you played part of the video. A gray circle means that you played the
entire video.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video screen.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.

==================================
How can I see captions?
==================================

While a video plays, select **Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right,
and then select **Closed Captions**. If the video has captions, a list of
available languages appears. Select the language that you want from the list.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_CCwithLanguages.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Video with closed caption language menu visible.

Some courses have captions in only one language, while others offer several
language choices.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds on the iPhone app. While a video plays, select
**Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right, and then select **Video
Speed**.

On the Android app, videos currently run only in their original speeds. We are
working on the ability to change video speeds.

========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

   .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_Menu.png
      :width: 300
      :alt: Mobile "My Courses" page with an arrow pointing to the menu in the
        upper left corner.

#. Select **My Settings**. 

#. Change the **Wi-Fi only download** setting.

.. note:: By default, the app is set so that it only downloads content, 
  including videos, if you are on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, 
  you might exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================
 
#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

#. Select **My Videos**.

#. On the **All Videos** page, select the course that has the video that you
   want to delete. Alternatively, select **Recent Videos**.

#. At the bottom of the list of videos, select **Edit**. A "selection" icon
   appears next to each video name and at the top of the page.

#. Select the videos that you want to delete. To select all of the videos,
   select the icon at the top of the page.

#. Select **Delete**.
