Video Questions

How do I download videos?
================================

"download" icon that appears to the right of a subsection or video name.

    :alt: List of subsections with the "download" icon circled.
  
To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download a
video, you can watch it at any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading
any video can result in heavy data use. EdX recommends using a Wi-Fi connection
if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX mobile apps have a
**Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid
using your cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a subsection name indicates the number of videos in
that subsection.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape mode, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video player.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds on the iPhone app. While a video plays, select
**Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right, and then select **Video
Speed**.

On the Android app, videos currently play only at their original speeds. 

========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

   .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_Menu.png
      :width: 300
      :alt: Mobile "My Courses" page with an arrow pointing to the menu in the
        upper left corner.

#. Select **My Settings**. 

#. Change the **Wi-Fi only download** setting.

.. note:: By default, the apps are set so that they only download content, 
  including videos, if you are on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, 
  you might exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================
 
#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

#. Select **My Videos**.

#. On the **All Videos** page, select the course that has the video that you
   want to delete. Alternatively, select **Recent Videos**.

#. At the bottom of the list of videos, select **Edit**. A "selection" icon
   appears next to each video name and at the top of the page.

#. Select the videos that you want to delete. To select all of the videos,
   select the icon at the top of the page.

#. Select **Delete**.

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video names?
========================================================

Each circle indicates whether you have already played a video. A blue circle
means that you have not started playing the video. A half-filled circle means
that you played part of the video. A gray circle means that you played the
entire video.
