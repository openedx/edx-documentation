The edX mobile apps are companions to the `edx.org`_ website. You can use the
apps to download course videos so that you can watch them whenever you want to,
even without an Internet connection. To access the rest of the course,
including homework and quizzes, you use a web browser on a computer.

There is an edX mobile app for Android smartphones and an app for iPhones.

Video Questions
*************************

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos,  you must be connected to the Internet. Select the
"download" icon that appears to the right of each subsection or video
name.

* If you select download for a subsection, you download all of the
  videos in that subsection.

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download
a video, you can watch it any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading
any video can result in heavy data use. We recommend using a Wi-Fi connection
if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX app has a
**Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid
using your cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of the subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a subsection name indicates how many videos there
are in that subsection.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape mode, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video player.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png

   :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.

==================================
How can I see captions?
==================================

While a video plays, select **Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right,
and then select **Closed Captions**. If the video has captions, a list of
available languages appears. Select the language that you want from the list.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_CCwithLanguages.png

   :alt: Video with closed caption language menu visible.

Some courses have captions in only one language, while others offer several
language choices.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds in the iPhone app. While a video plays, select
**Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right, and then select **Video
Speed**.

In the Android app, videos currently run only in their original speeds. 

========================================
How do I change my download settings?

  you might exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================
 
#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

#. Select **My Videos**.

#. On the **All Videos** page, select the course that has the video that you
