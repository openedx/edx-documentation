Overview of the edX Mobile App
********************************************************

.. only:: Partners

  The edX mobile app is a companion to the `edx.org`_ website.

You can use the app to download course videos so that you can watch them
whenever you want to, even without an Internet connection. When you have an
Internet connection, you can also read course announcements, participate in
course discussions, and get started on homework and other assignments. To
complete an entire course, you use a web browser on a computer.

========================================================
Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?
========================================================

Not entirely. With the edX mobile app, you can download course videos to watch
when you do not have an Internet connection. When you have an Internet
connection, you can also read course announcements and content, participate in
course discussions, and do some, but not all, of the problems in your
assignments. To complete an entire course, you use a web browser on a computer.

 ==================================================
 How do I share a link to a course I am taking?
 ==================================================

 After you enroll in a course, you can let family and friends know about the
 course by sharing a link to it on a connected social account, or in an email
 message.

 From a course's main page, select the **Share** icon in the course's title
 display.

 On the page that opens, select how you want to share the link. For example,
 select **Facebook** to post a link to the course on your Facebook wall.


========================================================
How do I post questions on the discussion board?
========================================================

You can read and contribute to course discussions in the edX mobile apps
whenever you have an Internet connection. In your course, select **Discussion**.
You can then browse through different topics or search for words or phrases that
interest you. For information about course discussions, see :ref:`Course
Discussions`.

How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. Select the
"download" icon that appears to the right of a subsection or video name.

  that subsection.

* If you select download for a video, you download only that video.

  This example lists subsections in a course and shows how many videos
  that will download when you select the icon.

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download a
video, you can watch it at any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading
any video can result in heavy data use. EdX recommends using a Wi-Fi connection
if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX mobile apps have a
**Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid
using your cellular network accidentally.

==========================================================
What are the numbers to the right of subsection names?
==========================================================

The number to the right of a subsection name indicates the number of videos in
that subsection.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape mode, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video player.

   :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds on the iPhone app. While a video plays, select
**Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right, and then select **Video
Speed**.

On the Android app, videos currently play only at their original speeds.

========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

   .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_Menu.png
      :width: 300
      :alt: Mobile "My Courses" page with an arrow pointing to the menu in the
        upper left corner.

#. Select **My Settings**.

#. Change the **Wi-Fi only download** setting.

.. note:: By default, the apps are set so that they only download content,
  including videos, if you are on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting,
  you might exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

==================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
==================================

#. On the **My Courses** page, select the menu in the upper left corner.

#. Select **My Videos**.

#. On the **All Videos** page, select the course that has the video that you
   want to delete. Alternatively, select **Recent Videos**.

#. At the bottom of the list of videos, select **Edit**. A "selection" icon
   appears next to each video name and at the top of the page.

#. Select the videos that you want to delete. To select all of the videos,
   select the icon at the top of the page.

#. Select **Delete**.

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video names?
========================================================

Each circle indicates whether you have already played a video. A blue circle
means that you have not started playing the video. A half-filled circle means
that you played part of the video. A gray circle means that you played the
entire video.
