Test Environment Rules

#. You must take the exam in the same room that you scanned during the
   proctoring setup for the current exam.

   .. note::
     You must complete a webcam scan of the room where you will take the exam
     every time you take a proctored exam. However, you do not have to take all
     of your proctored exams in the same room.

#. No other person is allowed to enter the room while you are taking the
   proctored exam.

#. The lighting in the room must be bright enough to be considered "daylight"
   quality. Overhead lighting is preferred. If overhead lighting is not
   available, the source of light must not be behind you.
