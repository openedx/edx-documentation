.. For this Open edX doc, in addition to adding feature info that is not yet
.. available for edx.org, I stripped out the most obvious references to edx
.. and edx.org, including XSeries, edX course catalog, paying for verified
.. certs and donations, etc.

Most courses offer a certificate when you complete the course successfully.
The certificate includes your name, the name of the course, organization that
created the course, and the names of one or more members of the course team.
The certificate also lists a URL that viewers can use to verify the
authenticity of the certificate.

Certificates do not include a grade or specify a number of credit hours that
the course might earn in a university.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then select **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

****************************
Selecting a Certificate Type
****************************

Different types of certificates might be available for courses you take: for
example, "honor code" or "verified". You select the certificate type you want
when you enroll in a course.

For more information about enrolling in a course, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling in a
Course`.

Honor code and verified certificates show that you have completed a single honor
code or verified course. 

The type of certificate appears in a color-coded tag under the course image on
your dashboard:

   courses



.. note:: Some courses might not offer certificates. If you want evidence that
  you completed the course, you can print a copy of the **Progress** page in
  the course.


=========================
Honor Code Certificates
=========================

Honor code certificates are free of charge to all students and are available for
all except a few specific courses. When you audit a course, or you take a course
that doesn't offer verified certificates, you'll automatically receive an honor
code certificate if you meet the requirements to pass the course.

=========================
Verified Certificates
=========================

A verified certificate shows not only that you successfully completed your
course, but also that you've verified your identity by using a webcam and an
official ID from your country or region. You may want to work toward a
verified certificate if you plan to use your course for job applications,
promotions, or school applications.

.. image:: /Images/SFD_VerCert.png

   :alt: Example edX honor code certificate

If a course offers verified certificates, you see a "Verified" tag on the
course image in the list of courses.

Verified certificates are usually available for a fee that varies by course.
For more information about the fee for a particular course, see the About page
for that course.

When you enroll in a verified course, you use a webcam to submit a photo of
yourself and of an official ID to the platform's secure authorization service.
During the course, you may be asked to use the same method to re-verify your
identity periodically. If your computer does not have a webcam, you must
register for the verified certificate on a computer that has a webcam.


****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You might register for one type of certificate but later decide that you want
a different type of certificate. For example, you might register for an honor
code certificate, but later want to change to a verified certificate. You can
change the certificate type until registration for verified certificates ends
for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course starts.

* To upgrade to a verified certificate, go to your dashboard, and then select
  **Challenge Yourself!** under the name of your course. You'll then follow the
  onscreen instructions to register for a verified certificate.

  If registration for verified certificates has closed, you can't change your
  certificate type. Registration for verified certificates typically closes two
  weeks after the course has started, or after at least one assignment due date
  has passed.

* To change from a verified certificate to an honor code certificate, go to your
  dashboard, and then select **Unregister** under the name of your course. The
  edX support team will contact you with information about a refund. You must
  change to an honor code certificate before verified certificate registration
  closes for your course if you want to receive a refund.

  If you don't see the **Unregister** button, registration for verified
  certificates has closed. Registration for verified certificates typically
  closes two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one
  assignment due date has passed. 


*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends; usually within two
weeks. After the course ends, you will see the following message under the
course name on your dashboard:

::

  Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
  will be available shortly.

When your certificate is ready, your dashboard will show you your final grade
for the class as well as a link to your certificate.

If you want a paper copy of your certificate, you can select **View
Certificate** to view your certificate. You can then print the certificate
from the certificate web page.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then select **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

=============================================
Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
=============================================

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through the courseware
at your own pace.

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you've completed all course assignments
and the final exam (if applicable), a certificate is generated automatically.
You don't have to complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others issue
certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's specific
certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Course Info** tab for your
course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates: 

On-Demand Certificates
*********************************

A few self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to access your certificate as soon as you complete enough of the
course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate. You do not have
to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out if a course
offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

.. image:: /Images/SFD_Cert_QualifiedOnDemand.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Image of the top of a Progress page, with the text "Congratulations,
      you've qualified for a certificate!"

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate. Note, however, that if you request your certificate before the
end of the course, the grade that you see on your dashboard no longer updates
automatically as you complete coursework. Your **Progress** page continues to
reflect your current grade. To update your grade on your dashboard, request
your certificate again.

.. note:: Your course grade does not appear on your certificate.

you change your full name on the **Account Settings** page before you request
