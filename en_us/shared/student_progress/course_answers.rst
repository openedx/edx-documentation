.. _Interpret a Student Submission History:

==========================================
Interpret a Learner's Submission History
==========================================

The Submission History Viewer shows every timestamped database record of the
interactions between a learner and a problem, which can include processes
completed both in the browser and on the server. These records appear with the
most recent interaction at the top of the Submission History Viewer, followed
by each previous interaction.

This topic provides an example submission history for a CAPA problem with
guidelines that can help you interpret a submission history. The number and
complexity of the records that appear in this report vary based on the type of
problem and the settings and features defined.

**Record 1: Problem Viewed (Server)**

The first interaction, shown at the bottom of the Submission History, records
when the server delivered the problem component to the browser for the learner
to view.

  }


**Record 2: Problem Checked (Browser)**

The next interaction shown as you scroll up from the bottom records when the
learner selected **Submit** in the browser to submit an answer. Note that this
record does not contain the actual answer submitted.

    "student_answers": {
      "e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": "choice_1"
  }


**Record 3: Problem Checked (Server)**

The next interaction records the results of the server processing that occurred
after the learner submitted the answer. This record includes
``student_answers`` with the submitted answer value, along with ``attempts``,
``correctness``, and other values.

    }
  }


**Record 4: Problem Retried (Browser)**

When a problem gives learners multiple attempts at the correct answer, and the
learner tries again, an additional record is added when a learner selects
**Submit** again. The server has not yet processed the new submission, so the
data in the record is almost identical to the data in record 3.

**Record 5: Problem Retried (Server)**

The most recent interaction in this example records the results after the
learner attempts the problem again and submits a different answer. Note the
differences between values in this record and in record 3, including the
reported ``Score`` and the values for ``student_answers``, ``attempts``, and
``correctness``.

============================================================
Report All Learners' Answer Submissions
============================================================

Before you can download a report of all learner answers for a problem, you need
the :ref:`unique identifier<find_URL>` of the problem that you want to
investigate.

To download the Student State report, which is a report of the answers
submitted for a problem by every learner, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download**.

#. In the **Reports** section, enter the **Problem location** . For CAPA
   problems, you can use the **Staff Debug Info** option to :ref:`find this
   identifier<find_URL>` for a problem.

#. Select **Download a CSV of problem responses**.

#. At the bottom of the page, select the
   ``{course_id}_student_state_from_{problem_location}_{date}.csv`` file.

#. Use a text editor or spreadsheet application to open the file. For more
   information, see :ref:`Interpret the Student State Report`.

.. _Interpret the Student State Report:

============================================================
Interpret the Student State Report
============================================================

The Student State report contains a row for each learner who has viewed a
problem or submitted an answer for the problem, identified by username. The
**State** column reports the results of the server processing for each
learner's most recently submitted answer.

When you open the report, the value in the **State** column appears on a single
line. This value is a record in JSON format. An example record for a text input
CAPA problem follows.

``{"correct_map": {"e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": {"hint": "", "hintmode": null, "correctness": "correct", "msg": "", "answervariable": null, "npoints": null, "queuestate": null}}, "input_state": {"e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": {}}, "last_submission_time": "2015-10-26T17:32:20Z", "attempts": 3, "seed": 1, "done": true, "student_answers": {"e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": "choice_2"}}``

You can use a JSON "pretty print" tool or script to make the value in the
**State** column more readable, as in the following example.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "correct_map": {
      "e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": {
        "hint": "",
        "hintmode": null,
        "correctness": "correct",
        "msg": "",
        "answervariable": null,
        "npoints": null,
        "queuestate": null
      }
    },
    "input_state": {
      "e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": {

      }
    },
    "last_submission_time": "2015-10-26T17:32:20Z",
    "attempts": 3,
    "seed": 1,
    "done": true,
    "student_answers": {
      "e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": "choice_2"
    }
  }

When you add line breaks and spacing to the value in the **State** column for
this CAPA problem, it becomes possible to recognize its similarity to the
server problem check records in the Submission History. For more information,
see :ref:`Interpret a Student Submission History`.

A **State** value that appears as follows indicates a learner who has viewed a
CAPA problem, but not yet submitted an answer.

  ``{"seed": 1, "input_state": {"e58b639b86db44ca89652b30ea566830_2_1": {}}}``

For open response assessment problems, the **State** value appears as follows
for learners who have submitted an answer.

  ``{"submission_uuid": "c359b484-5644-11e5-a166-0a4a2062d211", "no_peers": false}``

For open response assessment problems, ``"no_peers": false`` indicates that the
learner has completed at least one peer assessment, while ``"no_peers": true``
indicates that no peer assessments have been submitted.

.. _Student_Answer_Distribution:

****************************************
Student Answer Distribution
****************************************

For certain types of problems in your course, you can download a .csv file with
data about the distribution of learner answers. Student answer distribution
data is included in the file for problems of these types.

* Checkboxes (``<choiceresponse>``)
* Dropdown (``<optionresponse>``)
* Multiple choice (``<multiplechoiceresponse>``)
* Numerical input (``<numericalresponse>``)
* Text input (``<stringresponse>``)
* Math expression input (``<formularesponse>``)

The file includes a row for each problem-answer combination selected by your
learners. For example, for a problem that has a total of five possible answers
the file includes up to five rows, one for each answer selected by at least one
learner. For problems with **Randomization** enabled in Studio (sometimes
called rerandomization), there is one row for each problem-variant-answer
combination selected by your learners. For more information, see :ref:`Problem
Settings`.

.. note:: Certain types of problems can be set up to :ref:`award partial
  credit<Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem>`. When a learner receives
  either the full or a partial score for a problem, this report includes that
  answer as correct.

The .csv file contains the following columns.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Column
     - Description
   * - ModuleID
     - The internal identifier for the problem component.
   * - PartID
     - For a problem component that contains multiple problems, the internal
       identifier for each individual problem. For a problem component that
       contains a single problem, the internal identifier of that problem.
   * - Correct Answer
     - 0 if this **AnswerValue** is incorrect, or 1 if this **AnswerValue** is
       correct.

       For a problem that is set up to award partial credit, 1 if the
       **AnswerValue** awards either the full or a partial score.

   * - Count
     - The number of times that learners entered or selected this answer as
       their most recent submission for the problem or problem variant. For
       problems with the number of **Attempts** set to a value greater than 1,
       this means that each learner contributes a maximum of 1 to this count,
       even if the same answer is provided in multiple attempts.
   * - ValueID
     - The internal identifier of the answer choice for checkboxes and multiple
       choice problems. Blank for dropdown, numerical input, text input, and
       math expression input problems.
   * - AnswerValue
     - The text label of the answer choice for checkboxes, dropdown, and
       multiple choice problems. The value entered by the learner for numerical
       input, text input, and math expression input problems.
   * - Variant
     - For problems that use the **Randomization** setting in Studio, contains
       the unique identifier for a variant of the problem. Blank for problems
       that do not use the **Randomization** setting, or that use the **Never**
       option for this setting.
   * - Problem Display Name
     - The **Display Name** defined for the problem.
   * - Question
     - The text in the problem that is identified with accessible label
       formatting. In Studio's :ref:`Simple Editor`, this text appears with two
       angle brackets on either side pointing inward. For example, ``>>Is this
       the question text?<<``. This column does not include a value for
       problems that do not have an accessible label defined.

Entries are sorted by the value in each column, starting with the ModuleID on
the left and continuing through the columns to the right.

==========================================================================
Frequently Asked Questions about the Student Answer Distribution Report
==========================================================================

Answers to questions about the student answer distribution report follow.

**My course doesn't have a student answer distribution report. How can I
generate it?**

Student answer distribution reports are generated automatically, and refreshed
several times each day. The ``{course_id}_answer_distribution.csv`` file
displays after all of the ``{course_id}_grade_report_{date}.csv`` files. Be
sure to scroll to the end of the list of available reports.

**Why are some problems missing from this report? The ones that are missing do
have the problem types listed under** :ref:`Review_Answers`.

This report includes only problems that at least one learner has answered since
early March 2014. For those problems, this report only includes activity that
occurred after October 2013.

**Why don't I see an AnswerValue for some of my problems?**

For checkboxes and multiple choice problems, the answer choices actually
selected by a learner after early March 2014 display as described in the
previous answer. Answer choices selected by at least one learner after October
2013, but not selected since early March 2014, are included on the report but
do not include an **AnswerValue**. The **ValueID** does display the internal
identifiers, such as choice_1 and choice_2, for those answers.

**Why don't I see a Question for some of my problems?**

The value in the **Question** column is the question text that you identified
for the problem with the accessible label formatting. If you did not identify
question text for the problem, you will not see a question. For more
information about how to set up accessible labels for problems, see
:ref:`Simple Editor`.

Also, for problems that use the **Randomization** setting in Studio, if a
particular answer has not been selected since early March 2014, the
**Question** is blank for that answer.

**My learners are saying that they answered a question, but it isn't showing up
in the report. How can that be?**

Only questions that have a **Maximum Attempts** setting of 1 or higher are
included on the report.

**I made a correction to a problem after it was released. How can I tell which
learners tried to answer it before I made the change?**

Problem **Count** values reflect the entire problem history. If you change a
problem after it is released, it may not be possible for you to determine which
answers were given before and after you made the change.

**Why is the same answer showing up in two different rows when I view the
report in a spreadsheet?**

Some spreadsheet applications can alter the data in the .csv report for display
purposes. For example, for different learner answers of "0.5" and ".5" Excel
correctly includes the two different lines from the .csv, but displays the
**AnswerValue** on both of them as "0.5". If you notice answers that appear to
be the same on separate lines with separate counts, you can review the actual,
unaltered data by opening the .csv file in a text editor.

**Why are there strange characters in the report when I view it in a
spreadsheet?**

The .csv file is UTF-8 encoded, but not all spreadsheet applications interpret
and render UTF-8 encoded characters correctly. For example, a student answer
distribution report with answer values in French displays differently in
Microsoft Excel for Mac than in OpenOffice Calc.

  Answer Values in Microsoft Excel for Mac:

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/student_answer_excel.png
     :alt: A spreadsheet that replaces accented French characters with
      underscores.

  Answer Values in OpenOffice Calc:

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/student_answer_calc.png
     :alt: A spreadsheet that displays accented French characters correctly.

If you notice characters that do not display as expected in a spreadsheet, try
a different spreadsheet application such as LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice to
open the .csv file.

====================================================
Interpret the Student Answer Distribution Report
====================================================

You can use the Student Answer Distribution report to review learner responses
to assignments, which can then help you evaluate the structure and completeness
of your course content and problem components.

As an example, you define a text input question in Studio to have a single
correct answer, "Warfarin". When you produce the Student Answer Distribution
report, you verify that this answer was in fact marked correct: there is a 1 in
the **Correct Answer** column for this **AnswerValue**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/SAD_Answer_Review.png
    :alt: In Excel, 5 rows show 5 answer values, 4 of which show comprehension
     of the question, but only 1 answer is marked as correct.

However, as you view the report you notice other learner answers that you did
not set up to be marked as correct in Studio, but that you might (or might not)
also consider to be correct, such as "Warfarin or Coumadin". The **Correct
Answer** column shows that the other answers were marked incorrect (0), but for
future iterations of your course you may want to revise the question or update
the problem to evaluate additional variations of the answer as correct.

Many spreadsheet applications offer data visualization options, such as charts
or graphs. Charts can help make your learners' common misconceptions easier to
identify.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/SAD_Column_Chart.png
    :alt: In Excel, AnswerValue and Count columns next to each other, values
        for 4 rows selected, and a column chart of the count for the 4 answers.

In this example, the Student Answer Distribution report is open in Microsoft
Excel. To create a chart that shows how many of your learners chose various
answers to a multiple choice question, you move the **AnswerValue** and
**Count** columns next to each other. After you click and drag to select the
report cells that contain the data you want to chart, you select the Charts
toolbar and then select the type of chart you want.

.. note:: Refer to the help for the spreadsheet application that you use for
 information on using these options. You may have to make changes to your
 spreadsheet, such as reordering columns. Save a copy of the file you
 originally downloaded as a backup before you begin.

You can adjust your course content based on common mistakes. While most
learners in this example selected the correct answer, the number of incorrect
answer(s) can guide future changes to the course content.
