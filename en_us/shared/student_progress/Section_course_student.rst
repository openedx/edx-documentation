Using the Learner Engagement Report
*************************************

With the learner engagement report, you can monitor what individual learners
are doing in your course. The report contains a row for each enrolled learner,
and has columns that quantify overall course activity and engagement with
course problems, videos, discussions, and textbooks.

With this report, you can identify which learners are, and which are not,
visiting course content. Further, you can identify the learners who are
attempting problems, playing videos, participating in discussions, or viewing
textbooks.

The server generates a new learner engagement report every day for the
previous day's activity. On Mondays, an additional report is generated to
summarize activity during the previous week (Monday through Sunday).
