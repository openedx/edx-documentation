Learner Grades and Grading
############################

You can review information about how grading is configured for your course, and
access learner grades, at any time after you create the course. You can also
make adjustments to learner grading for a problem, for a single learner or all
learners. For information about the grading data that you can access and the
changes you can make, see the following topics.

.. contents::

 :depth: 1

To review learner answers to course problems, you can check the answer
submissions for a specific problem, either for a selected learner or for all
learners. You can also review answer distribution data for all of the problems.
See :ref:`Review_Answers`.

For open response assessments, you can generate an ORA data report that
provides details of each learner's response and of assessments that were
performed on each response. For details, see :ref:`Generate ORA Report`.

For information about how you establish a grading policy and work with the
Problem components in your course, see :ref:`Grading Index` or
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

********************************************************
Review How Grading Is Configured for Your Course
********************************************************

You can review the assignment types that are graded and their respective
weights in the LMS by selecting **Instructor** to access the instructor
dashboard.

You establish a grading policy for your course when you create it in Studio.
While the course is running, you can view an XML representation of the
assignment types in your course and how they are weighted to determine
learners' grades.

..  DOC-290: research this statement before including anything like it: Below the list of graded assignment types and their weights, each *public* subsection and unit that contains an assignment is listed.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download** > **Grading
   Configuration**.

   A list of the assignment types in your course displays. In this example,
   Homework is weighted as 0.3 (30%) of the grade.

     :alt: Studio example of homework assignment type and grading weight.


.. important:: Any changes that you make to the course grading policy, to graded
   subsections, or to graded components after the course begins will affect
   learners' grades and their experience in the course as well as analysis of
   course data.

   EdX recommends that you announce any unavoidable grading related changes to
   learners by using, for example, updates on the **Course** page. You should
   also carefully track such changes for researchers.

.. _Access_grades:

****************************************************
Generate a Grade Report for All Learners in a Course
****************************************************

For any course, you can generate grades and then download a file with the
results for all learners in the course, including unenrolled learners. EdX
recommends that you generate a grade report as soon as certificates have been
issued for your course.

When you initiate calculations to grade learner work, a process starts on the
edX servers. The complexity of your grading configuration and the number of
learners in your course affect how long this process takes. You can download a
report of the calculated grades in a comma-separated values (.csv) file when
the grading process is complete.

You also have the option to review learner grades on the instructor dashboard.
For more information, see :ref:`gradebook`.

To generate and download the grade report for the learners in your course,
follow these steps.

.. important::
   Because the grade report file contains confidential, personally identifiable
   data, be sure to follow your institution's data stewardship policies when
   you open or save this file.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Data Download**.

#. To start the grading process, select **Generate Grade Report**.

   A status message indicates that the grading process is in progress. This
   process can take some time to complete, but you can navigate away from this
   page and do other work while it runs.

#. To check the progress of the grading process, reload the page in your
   browser and scroll down to the **Pending Tasks** section. The
   status of active tasks is shown in the table.

   When the report is complete, a linked .csv file name becomes available above
   the **Pending Tasks** section. File names are in the format
   ``{course_id}_grade_report_{datetime}.csv``. The most recently generated
   reports appear at the top of the list.

#. To open or save a grade report file, locate and select the link for the
   grade report you requested.

   You can open .csv files in a spreadsheet application to sort, graph, and
   compare data.

.. note::
   To prevent the accidental distribution of learner data, you can download
   grade report files only by selecting the links on this page. Do not copy
   these links for reuse elsewhere, as they expire within 5 minutes. The links
   on this page also expire if the page is open for more than 5 minutes. If
   necessary, refresh the page to generate new links.

.. _Interpret the Grade Report:

=============================
Interpreting the Grade Report
=============================

A grade report for your course is a time-stamped .csv file that identifies each
learner by ID, email address, and username, and provides a snapshot of their
cumulative course scores.

Scores in the grade report are presented by assignment. There is a column for
every assignment that is included in your grading configuration: each
homework, lab, midterm, final, and any other assignment type you added to your
course.

.. note:: The grade report does not include information about individual
   problems within assignments, or include learner answer distributions. For a
   report that shows problem-level information, see :ref:`problem_report`.

The report indicates the enrollment track for each learner. For professional
and verified track learners it also shows whether they have verified their
identity. The report shows whether each learner is eligible to receive a
certificate (determined by whether he has earned a passing grade at the time
the report was requested), whether a certificate has been generated, and the
type of certificate earned.

If your course includes :ref:`cohorts<Cohorts Overview>`, :ref:`content
experiments<Overview of Content Experiments>`, or
:ref:`teams<CA_Teams_Overview>`, the grade report includes additional columns
indicating the name of the cohort, experiment group, or team that each learner
belongs to.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Grade-Report-with-enroll-status.png
  :alt: A course grade report, opened in Excel, showing the grades achieved by
        learners on several homework assignments and the midterm.

The grade report .csv file contains one row of data for each learner, and
columns that provide the following information.

* Learner identifiers, including an internal **Student ID**, **Email** address,
  and **Username**.

* The overall **Grade**, with the total score a learner has currently attained
  in the course. This value is expressed as a decimal: a learner with a grade
  of 0.65 has earned 65% of the credit in the course, and a learner with a
  grade of 1 has earned 100%.

* Each **{assignment type} {number}** defined in your grading configuration,
  with the score that the learner attained for that specific assignment. For
  example, column Homework 3 shows the scores for the third homework
  assignment. If the learner did not attempt the assignment, the value is "Not
  Attempted". If the assignment was not available for the learner, the value
  is "Not Available".

* An **{assignment type} (Avg)** with each learner's current average score for
  that assignment type: for example, "Homework (Avg)". This column is not
  included if a particular assignment type has only one assignment.

  This assignment type average takes both dropped assignments and the
  assignment weight into account. For example, if the course includes five
  homework assignments and the course grading policy allows one homework
  assignment with the lowest score to be dropped, the homework assignment
  average in this grade report is calculated over four homework assignments
  rather than five. This average is then multiplied by the assignment weight to
  calculate the assignment type average.

* If :ref:`cohorts<Cohorts Overview>` are used in the course, a **Cohort Name**
  column indicates the name of the cohort that each learner belongs to,
  including the default cohort. The column is empty for learners who are not
  yet assigned to a cohort.

* If :ref:`content experiments<Overview of Content Experiments>` are used in
  the course, an **Experiment Group** column indicates the name of the
  experiment group that each learner belongs to within a group configuration.
  The column heading includes the name of the group configuration. The column
  is empty for learners who are not assigned to an experiment group. If you
  have more than one experiment group configuration in your course, you see one
  column for each group configuration.

* If :ref:`teams<CA_Teams_Overview>` are enabled in the course, a **Team Name**
  column indicates the name of the team that each learner belongs to. The
  column is empty for learners who have not joined a team.

* The **Enrollment Track** column indicates whether each learner is enrolled in
  the course in the honor code, verified, or professional education track.

* The **Verification Status** column indicates whether learners who are
  enrolled in course tracks that require ID verification have successfully
  verified their identities to edX by submitting an official photo ID via
  webcam. The value in this column is "N/A" for learners enrolled in course
  tracks that do not require ID verification, such as "Audit".

  A value of "Not ID Verified" in this column indicates that the learner is
  enrolled in a course mode that requires ID verification, such as "Verified",
  but she has not attempted ID verification, or her ID verification has failed
  or expired. A value of "ID Verified" indicates that the learner is enrolled
  in a course mode that requires ID verification, and her ID verification is
  current and valid.

* The **Certificate Eligible** column indicates whether a learner is eligible
  for a certificate for your course.

  The value in this column is "Y" for the following learners.

  * Verified learners who attained a passing grade before this report was
    requested. For example, the learner could have earned a passing grade in an
    earlier session, or run, of the course.

  * All whitelisted learners, regardless of grade or enrollment track.

  The value is "N" for the following learners.

  * Learners who did not attain a passing grade.

  * Learners who are in the audit track.

  * Learners who live in embargoed countries.

* For learners who are eligible to receive a certificate, the **Certificate
  Delivered** column has a value of "Y" when the certificates for a course have
  been generated. The value is "N" for learners who are not eligible to
  receive a certificate.

* The **Certificate Type** column indicates the type of certificate that the
  learner is eligible for, such as "honor" or "verified". If a learner is not
  eligible for a certificate, or if the certificates for a course have not yet
  been generated, the value in this column is "N/A".

* The **Enrollment Status** column indicates whether the learner is currently
  enrolled or unenrolled in the course.

.. _problem_report:

************************************************************
Generate a Problem Grade Report for All Learners in a Course
************************************************************

For any course, you can calculate grades for problems and generate a report
that can be downloaded. The problem grade report for a course shows the number
of points that each learner has earned for each problem, and the number of
possible points for every problem in the course. In addition, the
report shows the final grade score for each learner.

To generate and download the problem grade report for all learners who have
ever enrolled in your course, follow these steps.

======================================
Interpreting the Problem Grade Report
======================================

A problem grade report for your course is a time-stamped .csv file that
identifies each learner by ID, email address, and username, and provides a
snapshot of earned scores compared with the possible scores for each problem.

The problem grade report includes two columns for every problem that is
included in your grading configuration. For each homework, lab, midterm, or
final exam problem, there is one column for earned points, and one column for
possible points. In addition, the report shows the final grade score for each
learner, expressed as a decimal.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Problem_Grade_Report_Example.png
  :alt: An example problem grade report shown in Excel, showing the decimal
    final grade for learners as well as the earned vs possible points that they
    each achieved on several quiz assignments. A column for a midterm is only
    partially visible.

The .csv file contains one row of data for each learner, and columns that
provide the following information.

* Learner identifiers, including an internal **Student ID**, **Email** address,
  and **Username**.

* The **Grade** column shows the total score that a learner has currently
  attained in the course. This value is expressed as a decimal: a learner with
  a grade of 0.65 has earned 65% of the credit in the course, and a learner
  with a grade of 1 has earned 100%.

* For each problem (identified by assignment, subsection, and problem name), a
  column showing the number of points actually earned by each learner. If the
  learner did not attempt the assignment, the value is "Not Attempted". If the
  assignment is not available to the learner, the value in this column is "Not
  Available".

* For each problem (identified by assignment, subsection, and problem name), a
  column showing the number of points that it is possible to earn for the
  problem. If the assignment is not available to the learner, the value in
  this column is "Not Available".

.. _gradebook:

*************************************************

Course Completion
*****************

This chart represents how much of the course content learner’s have completed.
All units that can be completed are accounted for in this chart, including readings, videos,
graded assignments, practice assignments, and assignments with future scheduled release dates.

The :ref:`Subsection Visibility Setting<Content Hidden from Students>` in Studio impacts what content is represented in the Course Completion chart.

* Course content with a **Subsection Visibility Setting** of “Entirely Hide Subsection” will not appear in the chart.

* Course content in self-paced courses with a **Subsection Visibility Setting** of “Hide content after course end date” will not appear in the chart once the course has ended.

* Course content in instructor-paced courses with a **Subsection Visibility Setting** of “Hide content after due date” will not appear in the chart once the assignment’s due date has passed.

     :alt: Pie chart representing how much course content has been completed.

.. _grades_chart:

Grades
*****************

This feature displays the minimum passing grade in the course against the learner's current grade.
The :ref:`Assessment Visibility Setting<Problem Results Visibility>` in Studio impacts the grade calculation on the **Progress** page. Different settings
determine whether a graded assignment is considered when calculating the grade to display to the learner.

* If “Always Show Results” has been selected, the assignment will be factored into this grade.

* If “Never Show Results” has been selected, the assignment will not be factored into this grade. This does not change the learner’s grade within Gradebook. This also does not impact the learner’s eligibility for a certificate.

* If “Show When Subsection is Past Due” has been selected, the assignment will only be factored into this grade when the assignment due date has passed.

Regardless of which **Assessment Visibility Setting** is selected, it will not impact the grade within the **Gradebook** of the **Student Admin** tab.
A learner's certificate eligibility is based on the grade in the **Gradebook**.

Additionally, the Grades display includes a description of the :ref:`grade range<Set the Grade Range>` set for the course. The default grade range for a course is a binary Pass/Fail.
If your course has additional ranges, they will be displayed here.

.. _grade_summary:

Grade Summary
*************

The Grade Summary table breaks down each :ref:`assignment type<Configure the Assignment Types>` available in the course and the learner's performance in each type.
The grades displayed in this section follow the same calculation criteria as the :ref:`Grades<grades_chart>` feature. To recap, an assignment will be factored into
this grade calculation if its :ref:`Assessment Visibility Setting<Problem Results Visibility>` has been set to "Always Show Results" or "Show When Subsection is Past Due".

.. _detailed_grades:

Detailed Grades
***************

The Detailed Grades section is a list of all graded assignments in a course. Both the overall subsection grade
and the individual problem scores are included in this list. Assignments will not appear in this display if any of the following criteria are true:

* The assignment has its :ref:`Subsection Visibility Setting<Content Hidden from Students>` set to "Entirely Hide Subsection".

* The assignment has a future scheduled release date.

* The assignment is not graded and ``SHOW_UNGRADED_ASSIGNMENT_PROGRESS`` is not set to ``True`` in ``MFE_CONFIG``.

     :alt: Detailed Grades feature that displays subsection scores with ungraded problems.

.. _certificate_status:

Certificate Status
******************

Certificate Status will only be displayed if your course has a certificate option.
If your course is eligible, this feature will describe which of the following states the learner is in:

* **Passing**, where the learner has earned the minimum grade required to earn a certificate.

* **Not passing**, where the learner has not earned the minimum grade required to earn a certificate.

* **Audit learner**, where the learner is in an audit track and does not qualify for a certificate.

* **Certificate not yet available**, where the course is instructor-paced, and the certificate will not be available until after the course end date.

* **ID not verified**, where the learner has not completed their ID verification.

* **Can request certificate**, where the learner has earned a certificate, but the certificate has yet to be generated. In this case, the learner can request a certificate.

Adjust Grades for One or All Learners
****************************************

If you :ref:`modify a problem or its settings<Modifying a Released Problem>`
after learners have attempted to answer it, we recommend that you rescore the
changed problem so that learners' grades are updated.

You can adjust an individual learner's score for a problem using either the
**Staff Debug Info** option in the course, the gradebook that you can access
from the **Student Admin** tab of the instructor dashboard in the LMS,  or on
the **Student Admin** tab of the instructor dashboard in the LMS. To adjust
the scores for all enrolled learners at once, you use the options on the
**Student Admin** tab of the instructor dashboard in the LMS. If you use the
options in the instructor dashboard **Student Admin** tab, you need to
:ref:`obtain the unique location identifier<find_URL>` of the problem.

The following sections describe the various ways in which you can adjust
learners' scores when you cannot avoid making a correction or other change to
a problem.

.. _rescore:

==========================================
Rescore Learner Submissions for a Problem
==========================================

Each problem that you create for your course includes the definition of a
correct answer, and might also include a tolerance or acceptable alternatives.
If you make a change to the accepted answers for a problem, you can rescore any
learner responses that were already submitted.


.. note::
   You can only rescore problems that have a correct answer defined in edX
   Studio, including CAPA problems and drag and drop problems. This procedure
   cannot be used to rescore open response assessment (ORA) problems or
   problems that are scored by an external grader. For ORA problems, you can
   :ref:`override a learner assessment grade<Override a learner assessment
   grade>` in Studio.

   Additionally, errors might occur if you rescore a problem that has multiple
   response fields and you have completed any of the following actions.

   * You removed a response field.
   * You added a response field.
   * You reordered any of the response fields.

.. _reset_attempts:

=====================================
Reset Learner Attempts for a Problem
=====================================

When you create a problem, you can limit the number of times that a learner
can try to answer that problem correctly. If unexpected issues occur for a
problem, you can reset the value for one particular learner's attempts back to
zero so that the learner can begin work over again. If the unexpected behavior
affects all of the learners in your course, you can reset the number of
attempts for all learners to zero.

.. note:: You cannot use this method with open response assessment (ORA)
   problems. To allow a learner to start an ORA problem again and resubmit
   responses, you must :ref:`delete the learner's state<delete_state>`.

Reset Attempts for an Individual Learner
****************************************

To reset the number of attempts for a single learner, follow these steps.

#. Obtain the learner's username or email address.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Course** and navigate to the component that contains the
   problem you want to reset.

 unique problem identifier, and then select **Reset Student Attempts**.

.. _delete_state:

=======================================
Delete a Learner's State for a Problem
=======================================

You can completely delete a learner's database history, or "state", for a
problem. You can only delete learner state for one learner at a time.

For example, you realize that a problem needs to be rewritten after only a few
of your learners have answered it. To resolve this situation, you rewrite the
problem and then delete learner state only for the affected learners so that
they can try again.

To delete a learner's entire history for a problem from the database, you need
that learner's username or email address.

.. important:: Learner state is deleted permanently by this process. This
   action cannot be undone.

   When you delete a learner's state for an open response assessment (ORA)
   problem, the learner will have to start the assignment from the beginning,
   including submitting responses and going through the required assessment
   steps.

You can use either the **Staff Debug Info** option or the instructor dashboard
to delete learner state.

To use the **Staff Debug Info** option, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Course** and navigate to the component that contains the
   problem.

#. Display the problem, and then select **Staff Debug Info**. The Staff Debug
   viewer opens.

#. In the **Username** field, enter the learner's email address or username,
   and then select **Delete Learner's State**. A message indicates a successful
   adjustment.

#. To close the Staff Debug viewer, click on the browser page outside of the
   viewer.

To use the instructor dashboard, you must first obtain the unique identifier of
the problem. See :ref:`find_URL`.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Student Admin**.

#. In the **Adjust a learner's grade for a specific problem** section of the
   page, enter both the learner's email address or username and the unique
   problem identifier, and then select **Delete Learner's State**.


.. _find_URL:

==================================================
Find the Unique Location Identifier for a Problem
==================================================

When you create each of the problems for a course, edX assigns a unique
location to it. To make grading adjustments for a problem, or to view data
about it, you need to specify the problem location.

Location identifiers for problems can be in one of these formats.

* ``location = block-v1:{org}+{course}+{run}+type@problem+block@{id}``, for
  example, ``location = block-v1:edX+BlendedX+1T2015+type@problem+block@72e0f73cdf5c4d648ebec0022854f18b``

* ``location = i4x://{org}/{course}/problem/{id}``, for example,
  ``location = i4x://edX/edX101/problem/680cc746e8ee473490841334f0235635``

Courses created since Fall 2014 typically have usage IDs in the first format,
while older courses have usage IDs in the second format.

To find the unique location identifier for a problem, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Course**, and then navigate to the unit that contains the
   problem.

#. Display the problem, and find the **Submission History** and **Staff Debug
   Info** options that appear below it.

#. Select **Staff Debug Info**. Information about the problem appears,
   including its **location**.

#. To copy the location of the problem, select the entire value after
   ``location =``, right click, and then select **Copy**.

To close the Staff Debug viewer, click on the browser page outside of the
viewer.
