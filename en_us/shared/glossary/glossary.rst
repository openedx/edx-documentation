  Announcing a Course`.


**accessible label**

  In a problem component, you use special formatting to identify the specific
  question that learners will answer by selecting options or entering text or
  numeric responses.

  This text is referred to as the accessible label because screen readers read
  all of the text that you supply for the problem and then repeat the text that
  is identified with this formatting immediately before reading the answer
  choices for the problem. This text is also used by reports and Insights to
  identify each problem.

  All problems require accessible labels.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Simple Editor`.

  A category within the course discussion that appears at a defined point in
  the course to encourage questions and conversations. To add a content-
  specific discussion topic to your course, you add a discussion component to
  a unit. Learners cannot contribute to a content-specific discussion topic
  until the release date of the section that contains it. Content-specific
  discussion topics can be divided by cohort, so that learners only see and
  respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort that they are
  in.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Discussion
  Components`. For information about making content-specific discussion topics
  divided by cohort, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in

  select a section, the section expands to show subsections. When you select a
  subsection, the first unit in that subsection appears on the course page.

  See also :ref:`Unit Navigation Bar<U>`.

.. _Course Page:

**Course page**

  The page that opens first when learners access your course. On the **Course**
  page, learners can view the course outline and directly access the course,
  either by clicking a specific section or subsection on the outline, or by
  clicking the **Start Course** button (**Resume Course** if the learner has
  previously accessed the course).

  The latest course update, such as a course welcome message, appears above the
  course outline. Links to various **Course Tools** including **Bookmarks**,
  **Reviews** and **Updates** appear at the side of this page. This page is a
  combination of the former **Home** and **Courseware** pages.

**course-wide discussion topic**

  Optional discussion categories that you create to guide how learners find
  and share information in the course discussion. Course-wide discussion
  topics are accessed from the **Discussion** page in your course. Examples of
  course-wide discussion topics include Announcements and Frequently Asked
  Questions. Learners can contribute to these topics as soon as your course
  starts. For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Discussions` and
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Create CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

  If you use cohorts in your course, you can divide course-wide discussion
  topics by cohort, so that although all learners see the same topics, they
  only see and respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort
  that they are in. For information about configuring discussion topics in
  courses that use cohorts, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in
  Cohorted Courses`.


.. _Custom Response Problem:

**discussion component**

  Discussion topics that course teams add directly to units. For example, a
  video component can be followed by a discussion component so that learners
  can discuss the video content without having to leave the page. When you add
  a discussion component to a unit, you create a content-specific discussion
  topic. See also :ref:`Content Specific Discussion Topic <Content Specific
  Discussion Topic_g>`.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Discussion
  Components`.

**discussion thread list**

  the LMS. The discussion thread list shows the discussion categories and
  subcategories in the course. When you select a category, the list shows all
  of the posts in that category. When you select a subcategory, the list shows
  all of the posts in that subcategory. Select a post to read it and its
  responses and comments, if any.

.. _enrollment_track_g:

**enrollment track**

  Also called **certificate type**, **course mode**, **course seat**, **course
  track**, **course type**, **enrollment mode**, or **seat type**.

  The enrollment track specifies the following items about a course.

    * The type of certificate, if any, that learners receive if they pass the
      course.
    * Whether learners must verify their identity to earn a certificate, using
      a webcam and a photo ID.
    * Whether the course requires a fee.

  * **audit**: This is the default enrollment track when learners enroll in a
    course. This track does not offer certificates, does not require identity
    verification, and does not require a course fee.

  * **professional**: This enrollment track is only used for specific
    professional education courses. The professional enrollment track offers
    certificates, requires identity verification, and requires a fee. Fees for
    the professional enrollment track are generally higher than fees for the
    verified enrollment track. Courses that offer the professional track do not
    offer a free enrollment track.

    .. note::
       If your course is part of a MicroMasters or professional certificate
       program, your course uses the verified track. These courses do not use
       the professional enrollment track.

  * **verified**: This enrollment track offers verified certificates to
    learners who pass the course, verify their identities, and pay a required
    course fee. A course that offers the verified enrollment track also
    automatically offers a free non-certificate enrollment track.

  * **honor**: This enrollment track was offered in the past and offered an
    honor code certificate to learners who pass the course. This track does not
    require identity verification and does not require a fee. Note, however,
    that as of December 2015, edx.org no longer offers honor code certificates.
    For more information, see `News About edX Certificates`_.

  .. only:: Partners

    * **credit**: In this enrollment track, learners who pass the course and
      comply with additional requirements, including identity verification, can
      receive academic credit for the course. For more information, see
      :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Academic Course Credit`.

  .. only:: Open_edX

    * **professional (no ID)**: Like the professional enrollment track, this
      track offers certificates and requires a fee. However, this track does
      not require identity verification. Courses that offer the professional
      (no ID) track do not offer a free enrollment track.
