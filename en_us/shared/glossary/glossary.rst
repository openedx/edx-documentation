  Announcing a Course`.


**accessible label**

  In a problem component, you use special formatting to identify the specific
  question that learners will answer by selecting options or entering text or
  numeric responses.

  This text is referred to as the accessible label because screen readers read
  all of the text that you supply for the problem and then repeat the text that
  is identified with this formatting immediately before reading the answer
  choices for the problem. This text is also used by reports and Insights to
  identify each problem.

  All problems require accessible labels.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Simple Editor`.

.. _Content Specific Discussion Topic_g:

**content-specific discussion topic**

  A category within the course discussion that appears at a defined point in
  the course to encourage questions and conversations. To add a content-
  specific discussion topic to your course, you add a discussion component to
  a unit. Learners cannot contribute to a content-specific discussion topic
  until the release date of the section that contains it. Content-specific
  discussion topics can be divided by cohort, so that learners only see and
  respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort that they are
  in.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Discussion
  Components`. For information about making content-specific discussion topics
  divided by cohort, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in

  See also :ref:`Unit Navigation Bar<U>`.

.. _Course Page:

**Course page**

  The page that opens first when learners access your course. On the **Course**
  page, learners can view the course outline and directly access the course,
  either by clicking a specific section or subsection on the outline, or by

  topics are accessed from the **Discussion** page in your course. Examples of
  course-wide discussion topics include Announcements and Frequently Asked
  Questions. Learners can contribute to these topics as soon as your course
  starts. For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Discussions` and
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Create CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

  If you use cohorts in your course, you can divide course-wide discussion
  topics by cohort, so that although all learners see the same topics, they
  only see and respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort
  that they are in. For information about configuring discussion topics in
  courses that use cohorts, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in
  Cohorted Courses`.


.. _Custom Response Problem:

**discussion component**

  Discussion topics that course teams add directly to units. For example, a
  video component can be followed by a discussion component so that learners
  can discuss the video content without having to leave the page. When you add
  a discussion component to a unit, you create a content-specific discussion
  topic. See also :ref:`Content Specific Discussion Topic <Content Specific
  Discussion Topic_g>`.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Discussion
  Components`.

**discussion thread list**

  The navigation frame that appears at one side of the **Discussion** page in
  the LMS. The discussion thread list shows the discussion categories and
  subcategories in the course. When you select a category, the list shows all
  of the posts in that category. When you select a subcategory, the list shows
  all of the posts in that subcategory. Select a post to read it and its
  responses and comments, if any.

  See :ref:`enrollment track<enrollment_track_g>`.

.. _enrollment_track_g:

**enrollment track**

  Also called **course mode**, **course track**, **course type**, **enrollment
  mode**, or **seat type**.

  The enrollment track specifies the following items about a course.

    * The type of certificate, if any, that learners receive if they pass the
      course.
    * Whether learners must verify their identity to earn a certificate, using
      a webcam and a photo ID.
    * Whether the course requires a fee.

  The edX platform offers the following enrollment tracks.

  * **audit**: The default enrollment track. This track does not offer
    certificates, does not require identity verification, and does not require
    a course fee.

  * **verified**: This enrollment track offers verified certificates to
    learners who pass the course, verify their identities, and pay a required
    course fee. A course that offers the verified enrollment track also
    automatically offers a free non-certificate enrollment track.

  * **honor**: This enrollment track offers an honor code certificate to
    learners who pass the course. This track does not require identity
    verification and does not require a fee. Note, however, that as of December
    2015, edx.org no longer offers honor code certificates. For more
    information, see `News About edX Certificates`_.

  .. only:: Open_edX

    * **professional**: This enrollment track is used for professional
      education courses. The professional enrollment track offers certificates,
      requires identity verification, and requires a fee. Fees for the
      professional enrollment track are generally higher than fees for the
      verified enrollment track. Courses that offer the professional track do
      not offer a free enrollment track.

    * **professional (no ID)**: Like the professional enrollment track, this
      track offers certificates and requires a fee. However, this track does
      not require identity verification. Courses that offer the professional
      (no ID) track do not offer a free enrollment track.
