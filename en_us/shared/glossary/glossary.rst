**About Page**

  The course page that provides potential learners with a course summary,
  prerequisites, a course video and image, and important dates.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:The Course About Page`.


**Accessible Label**

  In a problem component, you use special formatting to identify the specific
  question that learners will answer by selecting options or entering text or
  numeric responses.

  This text is referred to as the accessible label because screen readers read
  all of the text that you supply for the problem and then repeat the text that
  is identified with this formatting immediately before reading the answer
  choices for the problem. This text is also used by reports and Insights to
  identify each problem.

  All problems require accessible labels.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Simple Editor`.

  Other assessment methods are also available, and implemented using other
  XBlocks. An open response assessment is an example of a non-CAPA problem type.

.. _Certificate:

**Certificate**

  A document issued to an enrolled learner who successfully completes a course
  with the required passing grade. Not all edX courses offer certificates, and

  contain one or more components. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Developing Course Components`.

.. _Content Experiment:

**Content Experiment**

  You can define alternative course content to be delivered to different,
  randomly assigned groups of learners. Also known as A/B or split testing,
  you use content experiments to compare the performance of learners who have
  been exposed to different versions of the content. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Overview of Content Experiments`.


**Content Library**

  See :ref:`Library<Library_g>`.


.. _Content Specific Discussion Topic_g:

  specific discussion topic to your course, you add a discussion component to
  a unit. Learners cannot contribute to a content-specific discussion topic
  until the release date of the section that contains it. Content-specific
  discussion topics can be divided by cohort, so that learners only see and
  respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort that they are
  in.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Discussion
  Components`. For information about making content-specific discussion topics
  divided by cohort, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in

  In OLX (open learning XML) and in data packages, "courseware" refers to the
  main content of your course, consisting mainly of lessons and assessments.
  Courseware is organized into sections, subsections, units, and components.

  materials.

  Note that the **Course** page was formerly called the **Courseware** page.


**Course-Wide Discussion Topic**

  Optional discussion categories that you create to guide how learners find
  and share information in the course discussion. Course-wide discussion
  topics are accessed from the **Discussion** page in your course. Examples of
  course-wide discussion topics include Announcements and Frequently Asked
  Questions. Learners can contribute to these topics as soon as your course
  starts. For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Discussions` and
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Create CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

  If you use cohorts in your course, you can divide course-wide discussion
  topics by cohort, so that although all learners see the same topics, they
  only see and respond to posts and responses by other members of the cohort
  that they are in. For information about configuring discussion topics in
  courses that use cohorts, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set up Discussions in
  Cohorted Courses`.
