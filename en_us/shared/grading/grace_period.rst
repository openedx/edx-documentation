*************************
Set the Grace Period
*************************

You can set a grace period that extends homework due dates for your learners.
The grace period applies to the whole course; you cannot set different grace
periods for individual assignments.

.. note::
  The grace period setting does not apply to the following assignments and
  exams.

  * Timed exams. For more information, see :ref:`Grant Learners More Time for a
    Timed Exam`.
  * Proctored exams.
  * Open response assessments (unless the date configuration on the problem is set to
    use subsection due dates). For information about setting the response date
    for an ORA assignment, see :ref:`ORA Assignment Schedule <PA ORA Assignment Schedule>`.

On the **Grading** page, under **Grading Rules & Policies**, enter a value in
the **Grace Period on Deadline** field. Enter the value in ``HH:MM`` format.
