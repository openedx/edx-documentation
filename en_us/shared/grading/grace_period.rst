You can set a grace period that extends homework due dates for your learners.
The grace period applies to the whole course; you cannot set different grace
periods for individual assignments.

.. note:: The grace period setting does not apply to open response assessments.
   For details about setting the response date for an ORA assignment, see
   :ref:`Specify Assignment Names and Dates <PA Specify Name and Dates>`.

On the Grading page, under **Grading Rules & Policies**, enter a value in the
**Grace Period on Deadline** field. Enter the value in Hours:Minutes format.
