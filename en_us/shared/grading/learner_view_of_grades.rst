The Learner View of Grades
**************************

After a grading policy is in place, learners can view both their problem scores
and the percent completed and current grade in the **Progress** tab for the
course.

Each item in the X axis of the chart is for a graded subsection. Graded
problems in units are not broken out in the chart; the score from each problem
in the subsection is added to that vertical bar.

Graded subsections are grouped in the chart by assignment type rather than
listed in chronological order. For example, all homework exercises are grouped
together, followed by labs, then exams.

.. note::
 The **x** for an assignment in the Progress tab indicates that the grade for
 that assignment is currently dropped. You configure how many assignments are
 dropped when you :ref:`configure assignment types <Configure the Assignment
 Types>`.
