Graded Subsections
**********************************************

After you configure assignment types, as you are organizing your course, you
set the assignment type for subsections that contain problems that are to be
graded.

Each subsection that contains problems to be graded can include only one
assignment type.

.. note::
 You can only set assignment types and due dates at the subsection level. You
 cannot set assignment types or due dates for entire sections or for individual
 units within subsections. Additionally, you can designate a subsection as one,
 and only one, of the assignment types you configured.

For more information, see :ref:`Developing Course Subsections`.

For instructions on designating a subsection as a graded assignment, see
:ref:`Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`.

For more information about how to designate a subsection as a timed exam, see
:ref:`Timed Exams`.

Within a graded subsection, you create problems of the type designated for that
subsection. You cannot not mix problems of different assignment types in the
same subsection.

For example, if you want to create a homework assignment and a lab for a
specific topic, create two subsections. Set one subsection as the Homework
assignment type and the other as the Lab assignment type. Both subsections can
contain other content as well as the actual homework or lab problems.

.. note::
 You can create problems in Studio without specifying that the subsection is an
 assignment type. However, such problems do not count toward a learner's grade.

For more information about creating problems, see :ref:`Working with Problem
Components`.
