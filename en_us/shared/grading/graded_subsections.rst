.. _Graded Subsections:

**********************************************
Graded Subsections
**********************************************

After you configure assignment types, as you are organizing your course, you
set the assignment type for subsections that contain problems that are to be
graded.

You can only set assignment types and due dates at the subsection level. You
cannot set assignment types or due dates for entire sections or for individual
units within subsections. Additionally, you can designate a subsection as one,
and only one, of the assignment types you configured.

.. note:: You can create problems in Studio without specifying an assignment
   type for the subsection. Scores for such problems are listed as "practice
   scores" on the learner's **Progress** page and do not count toward the
   learner's grade.

   Hidden sections, subsections, or units that contain graded content are not
   included in grading and also do not count toward a learner's grade. For
   more information, see :ref:`Hiding Graded Content`.

Within a graded subsection, you create problems of the type designated for that
subsection. You cannot not mix problems of different assignment types in the
same subsection.

For example, if you want to create a homework assignment and a lab for a
specific topic, create two subsections. Set one subsection as the Homework
assignment type and the other as the Lab assignment type. Both subsections can
contain other content as well as the actual homework or lab problems.

For more information about creating problems and developing subsections, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components` and :ref:`Developing Course
Subsections`.

For more information about designating a subsection as a graded assignment,
see :ref:`Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`.

For more information about how to designate a subsection as a timed exam, see
:ref:`Timed Exams`.
