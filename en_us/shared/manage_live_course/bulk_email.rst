.. _Bulk Email:

##############################
Bulk Email
##############################

For courses on edx.org, you can send bulk email messages to course participants
directly from the instructor dashboard: in the LMS, select **Instructor**, and
then select **Email**.

Your messages can use HTML styling, and can include links to videos, social
media pages for the course, and other material. All course team members who
have the Staff or Admin role can use bulk email messages to communicate with
course participants before, during, and after the course run.

Learners are less likely to read and respond to email messages from courses
when they receive too many of them. As a best practice, do not send more than
one email message per week to course participants, unless there is good reason
to do so.

.. note:: Some courses use third party services such as MailChimp to send bulk
   email. Do not use both a third party service and the edX bulk email
   service. If you use more than one service to send email message, your
   messages are more likely to be marked as spam, and learners might not read
   them.

This section contains the following topics.

*************************
Message Addressing
*************************

When you send a bulk email message from the instructor dashboard, you choose
its recipients by selecting a **Send to** option. You can select one or more
recipient groups for each message. For details about who is included in each
of the preset recipient groups, see :ref:`Bulk Email Who Is Included or
Excluded`.

When you send a message to more than one recipient group, duplicate recipients
are filtered out, so that someone who belongs to more than one of the
recipient groups (for example, a course team member who is also enrolled in
the course) only receives one copy of the message.

The following preset recipient groups are available.

* **Myself**. Send an email message only to yourself, to test and review the
  message before sending it to a larger group.

* **Staff and Administrators**. Send an email message to members of the course
  team who have Staff or Admin privileges. For information about course
  team member privileges, see :ref:`Course_Staffing`.

* **All Learners**. Send an email message to all currently enrolled learners,
  including course team members who are enrolled in the course. This group
  does not include learners who have not activated their accounts, or who
  have opted out of receiving email communications.

In addition, if you have cohorts enabled in your course, each cohort is
available as a separate recipient group. For more information, see :ref:`Bulk
Email Cohorts`.


.. _Bulk Email Who Is Included or Excluded:

=========================================
Who Is Included in Each Recipient Group?
=========================================

When you send a bulk email message to one of the preset recipient groups, you
should be aware of who is included in each group.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 40 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Recipient Group
     - Includes
     - Does Not Include
   * - Staff and Administrators
     - * Any course team member who has the **Staff** role.
       * Any course team member who has the **Admin** role.
     - * Beta testers who do not also have the **Staff** or **Admin** role.
       * Discussion moderators who do not also have the **Staff** or **Admin** role.
       * Discussion administrators who do not also have the **Staff** or **Admin**
         role.
       * Discussion community TAs.
   * - All Learners
     - * All currently enrolled learners in your course, including those who
         have enrolled but have not yet accessed the course.
       * Course team members who are enrolled in your course.
     - * Learners who have not replied to the account activation email message
         that they received when they registered on edx.org.
       * Learners who have opted out of receiving email messages through the
         **Email Settings** link for the course on the learner's dashboard.

.. note:: To send an email message to all course team members as well as all
   learners, select both **Staff and Administrators** and **All Learners**.
   Recipients who are in both groups will receive only one copy of the email
   message.


.. _Bulk Email Cohorts:

===================================================
Sending Email Messages to Learners in Cohorts
===================================================

If you enable cohorts in your course, each cohort is available as a separate
recipient group. The recipient groups for individual cohorts only include
enrolled learners who have been assigned to a cohort, whether they were
automatically assigned when they accessed the course or manually assigned to a
cohort by a member of the course team.

The recipient groups for cohorts do not include enrolled learners who have not
been added to a cohort. This might be the case if they have not accessed the
course or have not been manually added to a cohort by a member of the course
team. To make sure such learners are included in email messages that are
intended for all enrolled learners, select the **All Learners** recipient
group instead of selecting all of the cohort recipient groups.

If a default cohort exists in your course, a recipient group named **Cohort:
Default Group** is also available.

.. note:: The default cohort is created only if you have not created at least
   one automated assignment cohort in your course by the time the first
   learner accesses course content. If learners access the course before you
   have created any automated cohorts, they are automatically placed in the
   default cohort, to ensure that all learners in the course belong to a
   cohort. You can manually reassign learners from the default cohort to
   another cohort. For more information, see :ref:`Default Cohort Group`.


.. _Options for Email Message Text:

*******************************
Composing Email Messages
*******************************

When you compose an email message, you can use the following options.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

=======
Styling
=======

Messages can include HTML styling, including text formatting and links. The
email message editor offers the same formatting options as the HTML component
editor in Studio.

For more information, see :ref:`Working with HTML Components`.

======
Images
======

Messages can include images. To include an image, you must first add the file
to your course on the **Files & Uploads** page. For an email message, you copy
the **Web** URL that the system assigns to the image. Then, in the email
message editor, you select the **Insert/edit image** icon to add the web URL.

To ensure that your course assets are transmitted securely, add the
``https://`` preface to the web URL. An example follows.

::

    https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:{course}.x+{run}+type@asset+block@{image}.jpg

For more information, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.

=========
Keywords
=========

Messages can include variables that represent values that are specific to each
message recipient, such as learner name or user ID. The LMS substitutes these
variables, called keywords, with actual values when it sends a message.

For more information, see :ref:`Use Keywords in Messages`.

.. _Send_Bulk_Email:

**************************************************
Send an Email Message to Course Participants
**************************************************

.. Important:: You cannot cancel bulk email messages after you send them.

   Before you send a message to a wide audience, send the message only to
   yourself to test and review it. Make sure it displays as you intend it to,
   and that any links or media function correctly.

To send an email message to course participants, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Email**.

#. From the **Send to** option, select one or more groups of email recipients.

   .. note:: Make sure you understand who is included or excluded when you
      send a message to one, or a combination, of the recipient groups. For
      details, see :ref:`Bulk Email Who Is Included or Excluded`

#. In the **Subject** field, enter a subject for the message.

#. In the **Message** box, enter the text for the message.

   For details about options for composing your message, see
   :ref:`Options for Email Message Text`.

#. Select **Send Email**. A bulk email task is queued for processing.

Multiple courses use the same queue to complete these tasks, so it can take
some time for your message to be sent to all of its recipients. You can
perform other tasks on the instructor dashboard or navigate to other pages
while you wait for your message to be sent.


.. _Use Keywords in Messages:

****************************
Use Keywords in Messages
****************************

You can include keywords in your messages. A keyword is a variable: when you
send the message, a value that is specific to the each recipient is substituted
for the keyword. For example, when you use the ``%%USER_FULLNAME%%`` keyword,
each message contains the name of the recipient.

.. note::
  Do not use keywords in the Subject line of a message. The keyword in the
  subject will not be assigned a value, and the recipient will see the keyword
  text.

===================
Supported Keywords
===================

You can use the following keywords in your messages.

* ``%%USER_ID%%`` - the anonymous user ID of the message recipient
* ``%%USER_FULLNAME%%`` - the full name of the message recipient
* ``%%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%%`` - the display name of the course
* ``%%COURSE_END_DATE%%`` - the end date of the course

===================
Keyword Formatting
===================

You format keywords as: ``%%Keyword%%``.  You can include keywords in any HTML
tags in an email message. An example follows.

::

  <h2>%%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%% Updates</h2>

  <p>Dear %%USER_FULLNAME%%, this is a reminder that the last day of the course
     is <b>%%COURSE_END_DATE%%</b></p>
  . . .

.. _Email_queuing:

****************************
Message Workflow States
****************************

When you select **Send Email** for a message, the server begins to process a
bulk email task. The server assigns a series of different workflow states to
the task.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Bulk_email_states.png
       :alt: Flowchart of the possible states of a bulk email task.

Bulk email tasks can have the following workflow states.

* Queuing: The bulk email task is created and being queued for background
  processing.
* Pending: The task is queued and is waiting to run.
* Started: Background processing is in progress to create emailing subtasks.
* Progress: The emailing subtasks are in progress.
* Success: All emailing subtasks are complete. Note that the bulk email task
  can be in this state even if some or all of its emailing subtasks failed.
* Failure: An error occurred and task processing did not complete successfully.

While the bulk email task is in progress, you can find out how far it has
gotten in the workflow by checking the **Pending Tasks** section on
the **Email** page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Bulk_email_pending.png
       :alt: Information about an email message, including who submitted it
             and when, in tabular format

When the bulk email task is complete, you can find its final state by checking
the Email Task History report. For more information, see :ref:`Email Task
History Report`.

.. _Review Sent Messages:

********************************
Review Sent Messages
********************************

You can review a list of all of the messages that have been sent for the
course. For any listed message, you can review the subject, the username of the
person who sent it, the date and time sent, its selected recipients, and the
message text.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Email**.

#. In the **Email Task History** section of the page, select **Sent Email
   History**. The list of sent messages displays.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/Bulk_email_list.png
    :alt: A tabular list of sent messages, with columns for subject, sent by,
          time sent, and number sent.

#. To review additional information for a message, select its subject. The
   message opens in a dialog box.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/Bulk_email_sent.png
    :alt: A dialog box with the subject, sent by, date and time sent, sent to,
          and message for an email message, and an option to Copy Email
          to Editor.

#. Optionally, use the message as the basis for a new message: select **Copy
   Email to Editor**. The dialog box closes and you can edit the text, links,
   and formatting that were duplicated into the **Subject** and **Message**
   fields.

   When you create a message by copying a previously-sent message, be sure to
   review and test it thoroughly before you send it to all course participants.

.. _Email Task History Report:

********************************
Email Task History Report
********************************

The Email Task History report can help you keep track of who sent messages,
when, and to how many people. For each message sent, the report includes the
username of the requester, the date and time it was submitted, the duration and
state of the entire task, the task status, and the task progress.

You can use this history to investigate questions relating to bulk email
messages that have been sent, such as these examples.

* How frequently learners are sent course-related email messages.
* Whether a message was sent successfully.
* The change in the number of people who were sent course-related messages over
  time.

To produce the Email Task History report, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Email**.

#. In the **Email Task History** section of the page, select **Show Email Task
   History**. A report like the following example displays on the instructor
   dashboard.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Bulk_email_history.png
       :width: 800
       :alt: A tabular report with a row for each message sent and columns for
        requester, date and time submitted, duration, state, task status, and
        task progress.

===========================
Review Email Task History
===========================

For tasks with a **State** of Success, the **Task Progress** column shows an
informational message. These messages can have a format such as "Message
successfully emailed for 13457 recipients (skipping 29) (out of 13486)". To
interpret this message, note that:

* The first number ("recipients") indicates the number of messages sent to the
  selected recipients.

* The second number ("skipping") indicates the number of enrolled and activated
  users who were not sent the message. This count is of learners who have opted
  not to receive course email messages.

* The final number ("out of") indicates the number of users in the set of
  recipients you selected who were enrolled in the course (and had activated
  their user accounts) when you sent the email message.

  Note that the **Total number of enrollees** shown on the **Home** page
  includes all currently enrolled learners, regardless of account activation
  status, and as a result can be different than this number.

If the "recipients" and "out of" numbers are the same, the message reads
"Message successfully emailed for 13457 recipients" instead.

Other **Task Progress** messages for tasks with a **State** of Success indicate
that some or all of the emailing subtasks did not successfully send email:

* "Message emailed for {number succeeded} of {number attempted} recipients"
* "Message failed to be emailed for any of {number attempted} recipients"
* "Unable to find any recipients to be emailed"

No **Task Progress** messages display for tasks that have a **State** of
Failure.

.. _Example Messages to Students:

*********************************
Example Messages to Learners
*********************************

You can use these example messages, prepared for delivery before typical course
milestones, as models for your own course communications.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

These messages are styled as email messages, but you could also post this
information in a course discussion topic or on the **Home** page. To use
:ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in Messages>`, you must send email messages;
keywords are not supported in discussion topics or the **Home** page.

.. important::
 Revise these message templates carefully to include facts for
 your own course, meet the needs of your learners, and reflect your own
 objectives and personality. Search for the "{" and "}" characters to locate
 prompts and replace them with course-specific values.

 Some of these messages also contain :ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in
 Messages>`. Values specific to your course and the recipients will be
 substituted for the keywords when you send the messages. Ensure you are using
 keywords appropriately for your course and objectives.

.. _Prelaunch Reminder:

====================
Pre-launch Reminder
====================

Pre-launch reminders raise awareness of the course start date, publicize the
course, and generate excitement. In addition to the course start date and time,
the example that follows also lets learners know that:

* UTC is used in edX courses. Alternatively, you could include information
  about your course or the edX platform that will contribute to your learners'
  success.

* The course has a companion social media site. Alternatively, you might
  include information about planned meetups or other community-building
  opportunities.

You may want to send out more than one message before the course launches: use
this template as a starting point for crafting the different messages you want
to deliver. Replace values enclosed by {braces} with information that applies
to your course. In addition, check that you are using :ref:`keywords <Use
Keywords in Messages>` appropriately.

::

  Subject: {course number} Starts Soon!

  Hello %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

  We are excited that you are joining us for {course number}
  %%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%%, offered by {organization name} through edX. Class
  begins on {day}, {date} at {time} UTC (which is {time} {local time zone}).
  Note that many dates and times in edX courses appear in your local time zone,
  but some might appear in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Dates and times
  that use your local time zone are followed by an indication of the time
  zone: for example, 17:00 Sept. 5, 2016 IOT. UTC dates and times do not
  have a time zone indicator. For UTC times, you might want to use a time zone
  converter such as {link}.

  In case you haven't already found it, {course number} has its own official
  Facebook page {add link}. You can find videos and photos posted there before
  the course even begins.

  If this is your first edX course, consider enrolling in the edX Demo course
  {add link}. This course gives you an opportunity to explore the edX platform
  and learn how to answer problems and track your progress, before {course
  number} begins.

  Your {course number} course staff

.. _Launch Day Welcome:

===================
Launch Day Welcome
===================

On your course start date, you can send an email message that both welcomes
learners and gives them specific actions to accomplish. This example directs
learners to two of the course pages to encourage exploration and discovery, and
personally introduces the course team leader. Search for the values enclosed by
{braces} in this template and replace them with information for your course.

::

  Subject: {course number} Starts Today!

  Hello everyone!

.. _Verified Registration Reminder:

==============================================
Reminder to Register for Verified Certificate
==============================================

After your course has launched, you can send an email to remind learners that
the last day to register for a verified certificate is approaching. You can use
this template as a starting point for your own message; search for the values
enclosed by {braces} and replace them with information for your course. In
addition, check that you are using :ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in Messages>`
appropriately.

::

  Subject: Earn an edX verified certificate for {course name}!

  Dear %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

  Interested in using an edX certificate to bolster a college application or to
  advance your career? With an edX verified certificate, you can demonstrate to

  Good luck!

  {name} and the {course number} staff

.. _Weekly Highlights:

==================
Weekly Highlights
==================

Sending a weekly email to learners can be a great way to keep them engaged and
provide encouragement. At the end of each week you might send learners an email
that summarizes the content covered, and reminds learners about upcoming
assessments or milestones in the course. Optionally, to encourage participation
in the discussion forums, you might also highlight particularly interesting or
important discussions, and provide links to the discussion topics.

You can use this template as a starting point for designing your own message,
omitting the discussion highlights if they are not appropriate for your course
(the example discussion highlights are from a course about urban solutions to
the global water crisis). Search for the values enclosed by {braces} and
replace them with information for your course. In addition, check that you are
using :ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in Messages>` appropriately.

::

  Subject: {Course Name} Week 1 Highlights

  We hope you all had a great week! Below, we have provided links to some
  exciting discussions that have been going on, and a Q&A video with
  {Professor} that recaps some of the questions that have come up this week.

  We'd also like to remind you to take this week's quiz by {date} at {time} UTC.
  The next module will be available on {Time and Date}.

  {Link to Video}

  Here are a few highlights from the discussion forum this week. Please join us
  online and keep the conversation going!

  * There has been quite a debate over whether urban stream restoration is
    possible and what types of restoration are desirable. How can we improve
    restoration practice and its outcomes? {Link to the Discussion}

  * Please continue to share your stories of urban stream restoration - there
    are many great examples here of what is possible! {Link to the Discussion}

  See you next week,

.. _Midcourse Encouragement:

========================
Mid-Course Encouragement
========================

While your course is running, you can send messages to promote community,
remind learners of upcoming due dates, and address any recurring issues.

This example gives learners guidance on how to keep up with the course schedule
and encourages contributions to the discussions. You may want to send out more
than one message while the course is running. You can use this template as a
starting point for your own messages; search for the values enclosed by
{braces} and replace them with information for your course. In
addition, check that you are using :ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in Messages>`
appropriately.

::

  Subject: {course name} Announcements

  Dear students,

  We hope that you are learning a lot in {course number}! Remember that problem
  set {number} is due on {date} at {time} UTC. You can always check the
  schedule {add link} on the Home page to plan ahead.

  The contributions to the course discussions have been amazing. You'll also
  see on the Home page that we have made several of you community
  TAs to thank you for your thoughtful contributions. Keep those conversations
  going!

  We have a few additional announcements.

  * Week {number} on {subject} is now available on the Course page.

  * Problem set {number} is also available. It is due on {date} at {time} UTC.

  * Remember that the due dates for problem sets and exams are in UTC (the GMT
    time zone). See the current UTC time here {add link}. Please convert the
    times given to your own time zone!

  Wishing you continued success in the course,

  {name} and the {course number} staff

.. _Midcourse Events:

========================
Mid-Course Event
========================

Before an exam or other significant course event, messages can provide
practical information about the exam, communicate expectations regarding
conduct, and also encourage learners to continue working toward course
completion. This example lets learners know:

* How long they have to complete the exam, and when they can see answers to
  questions.

* How to communicate any errors or other issues found during the exam to the
  course staff.

* Whether the course discussions will be open or closed during the exam. (In
  the example that follows, the discussions will remain **open**.)

* What constitutes an honor code violation.

* What technical limitations, if any, are imposed by external tools such as
  graders.

Be sure to search for the values enclosed by {braces} and replace them with
information for your course. In addition, check that you are using
:ref:`keywords <Use Keywords in Messages>` appropriately.

::

  Subject: {course number} Exam Info

  Hello %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

  Great job working through week {number}! As you know, the {course number}
  exam is next week. If you missed a problem set, you can still earn a
  certificate. Each problem set is worth only {number}% of the overall grade,
  but this exam is worth {number}%.

  Please read this important information about the exam before you begin taking
  it.

  * The exam starts on {date} at {time} UTC and must be finished by {date} at
    {time} UTC. Plan your schedule accordingly.

  * Be sure that you know what time the UTC deadline is in your time zone. See
    the current UTC time {add link}. No extensions will be given.

  * The exam is not timed. You can start, stop, and come back to it until the
    deadline.

  * Each exam question allows only one answer submission. If you accidentally
    click "Check", that problem cannot be reset for you.

  * The exam covers everything (video lectures, reading, and problem sets) from
    weeks {number}-{number}. If you missed any of these materials, you will
    want to review them before you take the exam.

  * You can use the textbook and the Internet to clarify your knowledge of exam
    topics, as long as you are not deliberately looking up answers to exam
    questions.

  * Course discussions will remain open during the exam, but anyone who posts
    an answer to an exam question will be violating the honor code and risk
    being removed from the class, forfeiting the certificate.

  * If you need to alert the staff to an issue with the exam while the exam is
    open, add a post to the General discussion topic and include [EXAM] in
    the subject line.

  * Check the Home page periodically. It is the fastest way the
    staff has to communicate any delays, corrections, or changes.

  Good luck!

  {name} and the {course number} staff

.. _Technical Issue:

========================
Technical Issue
========================

In the event of an unanticipated system failure, a message can both alert
learners to the problem and reassure them that the issue is either resolved or
being addressed. The message can also provide information about any changes
made to the course as a result.

Technical issues can arise during a course for many different reasons, so this
example is likely to need revision to apply to an issue that you encounter.
Keep in mind that to reassure the learners who are affected by the problem, the
message should have a positive tone, and calmly and briefly identify the
problem, the status of its solution, and any after effects.

::

  Dear students,

  We've encountered a technical problem with {video, assignment, etc. name}.
  {We are working to resolve it now. / This issue has been fixed.}

  As a result of this issue, we have {extended the deadline for / rescored}
  this assignment so that it will not affect your grade.

  Thanks for your patience, and we look forward to continuing the course with
  you.

  {name} and the {course number} staff

.. _Course Farewell and Certificates:

=================================
Course Farewell and Certificates
=================================

In the last few days before your course ends, a message can direct learners to
a course survey, answer questions about certificates, and provide information
about future access to course materials. Be sure to replace values enclosed by
{braces} with information for your course.

::

  Subject: {course number} Final Remarks

  Dear %%USER_FULLNAME%%,

  Thank you for making %%COURSE_DISPLAY_NAME%% so much fun these last few
  months! We had a great time getting to know you through the course
  discussions. We appreciate the effort that you put into this course, and we
  hope that you enjoyed learning {subject} through edX. With or without a
  certificate, you should be proud of your accomplishments.

  * Please take a few minutes to answer the exit survey, now available on the
    Course page. We will use your responses to improve the course in the
    future.

  * If you qualify for a certificate (overall score {number}% or higher), the
    edX dashboard will include a link to your certificate in the near future.
    While you may see the link in a few days, it can take up to two weeks for
    edX to generate all of the course certificates.

  * As an enrolled student, you will have access to the lecture videos even
    after the course ends. Assessments will remain, but you will no longer be
    able to submit answers to any problem sets or exams with due dates.

  * The {course number} discussions close on {date} at {time} UTC. You will not
    be able to add to the discussions after that time, but you will be able to
    continue viewing all of the conversations that took place during the
    course.

  We hope that you share what you learned in {course number} with your
  colleagues, friends, and family.

  Good luck on the final exam and beyond!

  {name} and the {course number} staff

.. _New Course Run Announcement:

=================================
New Course Run Announcement
=================================

When you prepare a course for a new run, you can use the bulk email feature in
its previous run (or runs) to inform an engaged and knowledgeable audience:
your former learners. Announcing a new run to learners of an earlier run gives
you the opportunity to highlight key aspects of the course, such as the quality
and variety of its discussions, or the global interest and relevance of the
subject, as demonstrated by past enrollment. You can also reveal new features
or content that have been added to the new course run. By emphasizing the
value of the course, you get people thinking and talking about their
experiences, build excitement, and encourage re-enrollment.

This message template offers learners who did not complete the course, or who
did not previously choose the verified certificate track, the opportunity to do
