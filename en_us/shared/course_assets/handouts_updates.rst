Adding Course Updates and Handouts
######################################################

You can create course updates and handouts in Studio.

Course updates are communications, especially a welcome message, that learners
see at the top of the **Course** page when they enter the course. A welcome
message is an important way of making each learner feel personally welcomed to
the course, and of providing orienting information that helps learners succeed
with the course.

After learners have read the welcome message, they can dismiss the message.
Learners can access the dismissed message and any other updates from the
**Updates** link in the sidebar on the **Course** page.

Handouts are links to files that you upload in Studio, for example, a PDF
version of the course syllabus, or an article that you want learners to read.
Learners see the list of course handouts under **Handouts** in the sidebar.

.. _Add a Course Update:

**********************
Add a Course Update
**********************

You create course updates in Studio. On entering the course, learners see the
update that has the latest date chronologically (including dates in the future)
on their **Course** page.

.. note:: Learners can dismiss the update that displays on their **Course** page
   after they have read it. When learners have dismissed a message, they can
   access the dismissed message and any other updates from the **Updates** link
   in the sidebar on the **Course** page.

On the **Updates** page in Studio, you see the list of updates sorted in the
order that they were created (most recent at the top of the list). If you
create a new update, learners do not see the update on the **Course** page
unless it has the latest chronological date of all existing updates.

To add a course update, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Updates** from the **Content** menu.
#. Select **New Update**.
#. Create your update in the text editor that opens.

   * Enter text for the update, using HTML tags for formatting. This editor is
     like the :ref:`raw HTML editor<The Raw HTML Editor>` in HTML components.
     The course update editor does not have a :ref:`visual editor<The Visual
     Editor>`.

     .. note::
        To make sure that your announcements are accessible, if you use
        headings inside an announcement, make sure that you use only level 6
        headings (``<h6>``). The structure of the course **Course** page uses
        heading levels 1-5.

        If you copy text from another source and paste it into the text
        editor, proofread the result carefully. Some applications automatically
        change quotation marks and apostrophes from the "straight" version to
        the "smart" or "curly" version. The editor requires "straight"
        quotation marks and apostrophes.

   * Specify a date for this update. By default, today's date is already
     entered. You can change the date using the calendar tool, or by entering
     some other valid date.

     .. note:: Learners do not see the update on the **Course** page unless it
        has the latest chronological date of all existing updates.

#. Select **Post**.

   Your new update becomes available to learners immediately. If the update
   has the latest chronological date, it is shown to learners on the
   **Course** page, otherwise the update appears on the **Updates** page.

.. The following step allows installations that use the edX mobile apps to send
.. a push notification to the app when an update is added. Alison, DOC-1814,

    #. Optionally, choose whether to send a notification about your update to
       the edX mobile app.

      * Learners can choose to turn off notifications for individual courses or
        for all courses. The **Home** page continues to show all
        updates.
      * All updates appear on the **Home** page, even if you do not send
        notifications.


.. _Add Course Handouts:

***************************
Add a Course Handout
***************************

To add a course handout, you :ref:`upload a file in Studio<Add Files to a
Course>`, then add an entry to an HTML-formatted list of handouts, specifying
the URL to your uploaded file and providing a handout title.

You can open the Studio **Files & Uploads** page in another browser window to
make this process easier.

To add a course handout, follow these steps.


#. In Studio, select **Updates** from the **Content** menu.

   On the **Updates** page, you see a **Course Updates** panel and a **Course
   Handouts** panel.

       panel.


#. In the **Course Handouts** panel, select **Edit**.

#. In the editor that opens, use HTML formatting to add a link to your
   uploaded file and a title for the handout. If there are no existing
   handouts, by default an empty ordered list tag is provided.

   An example using paragraph tags rather than a list, follows.

   .. code-block:: html

     <p><a href="/static/Syllabus_Fall2017.pdf" target="_blank">Syllabus</a></p>
     <p><a href="/static/Glossary_v3.pdf" target="_blank">Glossary</a></p>

#. Select **Save**.
