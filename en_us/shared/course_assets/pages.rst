.. _Adding Pages to a Course:

##################################
Managing the Pages in Your Course
##################################

This topic describes the pages, or tabs, that the LMS includes for your course
by default, how you can modify them, and how you can add more pages to your
course.

.. _Default Pages:

*******************************
Working with the Default Pages
*******************************

By default, every new course has the following pages.

* Course
* Discussion
* Wiki
* Progress

In the LMS, learners see these options in the navigation bar at the top of
every page.

 :alt: The navigation bar in the LMS, showing the default pages.

In addition, if you enable the :ref:`notes tool <Notes Tool>` for your course,
the system adds a **Notes** page. The system also adds a page for each
:ref:`textbook <Adding Textbooks>` that you add to the course. Note that in
Studio, all of your textbooks appear in one group, but in the LMS each one
appears as a separate page.

As a course team member with the **Staff** or **Admin** role, you also see the
**Instructor** option in the navigation bar. Learners do not see the
**Instructor** option.

To customize your course, you can make the following changes to the pages that
the system adds by default.

* You can :ref:`change the order<Reorder Pages>` in which the pages are
  presented, with the exception that the **Course** pages is always presented in
  the first position.

* If you do not want to use the **Wiki** or **Progress** page in your course,
  you can :ref:`hide<Show or Hide the Course Wiki Page>` one or both of them.

* If you want to change the name of a page that appears for a textbook, you
  can change the name that you entered for the textbook.

You can also :ref:`add custom pages<Add Page>`.

.. _Add Page:

***************************
Adding Custom Pages
***************************

You can customize your course by adding pages. Each page that you add appears
in the navigation bar for your course. When you add a page, you also add its
content using an HTML editor.

The following example shows the navigation bar for a course that has added
custom pages named **Syllabus** and **Extra Reading**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/page_bar_lms.png
 :alt: The navigation bar in the LMS with additional custom pages named
     "Syllabus" and "Extra Reading".

When you add a page, you can specify whether it and its content are visible
only to course team members who have the Admin or Staff role, or to all
enrolled learners as well as the course team. For more information about
assigning course team roles, see :ref:`Course_Staffing`.

===================
Add a Custom Page
===================

If you add a custom page to a course after its start date, and have specified
that the page should be visible to learners, the page is visible in the LMS as
soon as you save your work. As a best practice, be sure the following aspects
of your page design are ready before you add a page in Studio.

*  The content for the page, which can include HTML markup.
*  The name of the page.
*  The audience for the page (everyone, or course team members with the Admin
   or Staff roles only).

To add a custom page and its content to your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages**. A list of the pages
   that appear in the navigation bar for your course appears.

#. Select **Add a New Page**. The system adds a page named **Empty** to the end
   of the list.

#. In the row for the new page, select **Edit**. The :ref:`visual editor <The
   Visual Editor>` opens.

#. Enter the content for your page.

   To add HTML tags to your content, select **HTML** to open the :ref:`raw HTML
   editor<The Raw HTML Editor>`. For more information about entering content,
   see :ref:`Options for Editing HTML Components`.

   .. note:: If you copy text from another source and paste it into the visual
    editor, be sure to proofread the result carefully. Some applications
    automatically change quotation marks and apostrophes from the "straight"
    version to the "smart" or "curly" version. The raw HTML editor requires
    "straight" quotation marks and apostrophes.

#. To rename the page, select **Settings**, and then enter a **Display Name**.
   The display name is the label that course participants use in the course
   navigation bar.

#. To hide the page from learners, select **Settings**, and then select
   ``true`` for **Hide Page from Learners**. By default, pages are visible to
   learners.

#. Select **Save**.

The new page is immediately available to the specified audience if the course
has started.

.. _Show or Hide the Course Wiki Page:

********************************************
Hiding or Showing the Wiki or Progress Pages
********************************************

By default, your course includes a **Wiki** page and a **Progress** page. For
more information about how you can use these pages in a course, see
:ref:`Course_Wiki` or :ref:`check_student_progress`.

As part of your course design, you can decide whether you want learners to have
access to one or both of these pages. While you cannot delete these pages
completely, you can hide them so that they do not appear in the navigation bar
in the LMS. If you change your mind, you can show the pages again.

.. note:: The information on the **Progress** page can be motivating for
  learners, particularly in courses that include graded subsections, but also
  for courses that include only ungraded exercises. Before choosing to hide the
  **Progress** page for your course, consider the possible effect on learner
  engagement.

As a best practice, you should avoid changing the visibility of these pages
after your course starts. For example, your course includes the **Wiki** page
when it starts. A learner adds a page to the course wiki, and adds a browser
bookmark to that page. If you later hide the **Wiki** page, the learner's
browser bookmark will continue to provide access to the entire course wiki.

=======================================
Hide or Show the Wiki or Progress Pages
=======================================

If you hide or show a page after the course start date, note that the
visibility of the page in the LMS changes immediately.

To hide or show the **Wiki** or **Progress** pages, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages**.

   On the list of pages, each page that you can hide includes a **Show/hide
   page** icon.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/pages_wiki_on.png
    :alt: The list of default course pages. Only the Wiki and Progress pages
        have Show/Hide controls.

#. Select the **Show/hide page** icon to hide a page. The icon changes to
   indicate that the page is hidden, as shown in this example.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/pages_wiki_off.png
    :alt: The Wiki page on the list of course pages, with the show/hide
        icon indicating that the page is currently hidden.

#. Select the **Show/hide page** icon again to make the page visible.

.. _Reorder Pages:

*****************
Reorder the Pages
*****************

You can reorder the pages in your course in the same way that you
:ref:`reorganize the course outline<Reorganize the Course Outline>`: you drag a
page to different location in the list of pages and drop it there.

.. note:: You cannot change the order of the **Home** or **Course** pages,
  which are always presented in the first and second positions.

If you change the order of the pages after the course start date, note that the
change immediately affects the sequence of the options on the navigation bar in
the LMS.

To reorder the pages, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages**.

   On the list of pages, each page that you can move includes a **Drag to
   reorder** icon.

#. Move your pointer over the **Drag to reorder** icon for the page. Your
   pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.

#. Click and drag the page to the new location, and then release.

.. _Delete a Page:

*********************
Delete a Custom Page
*********************

You can delete any of the custom pages that were previously added to the
course.

* You cannot delete any of the :ref:`default pages<Default Pages>`. However,
  you can :ref:`hide<Show or Hide the Course Wiki Page>` the **Wiki** and the
  **Progress** pages.

* To delete a page that appears for a textbook, you delete the textbook.

If you delete a page after the course start date, note that the
visibility of the page in the LMS changes immediately.

To delete a custom page, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages**.

   On the list of pages, each page that you can delete includes a **Delete**
   icon.

#. Select the **Delete** icon, and then confirm the deletion.
