You can add PDF textbooks to your course.

.. note::
 Do not use image files (for example, .png files) as textbooks for your course,
 as they are not accessible to screen readers. For more information, review
 :ref:`Creating Accessible PDFs`.

Each textbook that you add is displayed to learners as a page, or tab, in the
course navigation bar.

EdX recommends that you upload a separate PDF for each chapter of your
textbook.

When learners open the textbook page in the course, they can navigate
the textbook by chapter.
