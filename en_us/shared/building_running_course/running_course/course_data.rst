After you create a course, you can access information about it from the
Instructor Dashboard. You can find:

* Identifying information for the course.

* Whether the course has started or ended.

* The defined grade cutoff for passing or failing.

Additional data about the course and its students is available from other pages
in the Instructor Dashboard, and from edX Insights. You also access Insights
from the Instructor Dashboard: click the link in the banner at the top of each
page. For more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.
