Using the Course Wiki
########################

Wikis provide a way for course staff and students to access, share, and
collaboratively edit information both about, and for, your course. 

Every course has a wiki that you can set up in a way appropriate for your
course. You can influence how students (and staff) use it by :ref:`seeding the
wiki<Seeding the Wiki>` with specific content, by explaining how you want it to
be used at the beginning of the course, and by providing clear instructions and
guidelines for its use.

Common uses for the course wiki might
be:

* Sharing answers to course FAQs and collecting new FAQs.
* Sharing editable course information, such as download and installation
  instructions for software required for the course
* Providing shared access to student-created resources, perhaps as part of a
  collaborative exercise. 
* Sharing errata for the course.
* Collecting suggestions for future runs of the course.

As students and staff create and edit wiki articles, they contribute to a
repository of information about your course that can be immediately useful to
other students, or useful for you and your course team as you develop other
courses or future runs of the same course.

The wiki for each course is a "child" wiki of the edX-wide wiki. From within any
course wiki, clicking the top level **Wiki** link in the breadcrumb trail at the
top of the page takes you to the edX-wide wiki.

.. Some courses have linked wikis, which can be useful for course re-runs or for course series. You link a wiki with another course's wiki by...?

.. _Wikis Overview:

********************************
Managing the Course Wiki
********************************

Keep these points in mind as you design the wiki for your course:

* Be clear about the purpose for the wiki or for different parts of the wiki. For example, are some parts of the wiki only for disseminating information? If that is the case, then make sure that only your course team has write access for those articles.

* Decide whether some parts of the wiki are intended for student collaboration or student input. Make sure that students are able to create and edit wiki articles in those sections, and use text to clearly indicate to students that these pages can be edited.

* Think about the different tasks that will be performed by people in different roles. Typically you want your course team to have some privileges that students do not have. For example, course staff can delete wiki articles, but students cannot.

Course staff can perform these tasks to manage the wiki:

* :ref:`Show or Hide the Wiki<Showing or Hiding the Wiki>`
* :ref:`Control Wiki Access<Controlling Wiki Access>`
* :ref:`Seed the Wiki<Seeding the Wiki>`
* :ref:`Lock a Wiki Article<Locking a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Delete a Wiki Article<Deleting a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Purge a Wiki Article<Purging a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Restore a Deleted Wiki Article<Restoring a Deleted Wiki Article>`
  
All users, including students, can perform the following tasks, depending on the permissions that you set for an article:

* :ref:`Add a Wiki Article<Adding a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Edit a Wiki Article<Editing a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Manage Versions of a Wiki Article<Managing Versions of a Wiki Article>`
* :ref:`Search for Wiki Articles<Searching for Wiki Articles>`

.. _Showing or Hiding the Wiki:

********************************
Showing or Hiding the Wiki
********************************

When you create a course, a wiki is included by default, and a **Wiki** tab is
visible at the top of the course page. If you do not want to use the course
wiki, you can hide the **Wiki** tab at the top of the course.

Follow these steps to show or hide the wiki in the course tabs.

#. Open your course in Studio.
#. Select **Content**, then **Pages**.
#. Click the eye icon in the **Wiki** row. The **Wiki** tab is hidden when the eye
   icon has a slash through it. You can show the **Wiki** tab again by clicking the eye icon.

When you hide the wiki in your course, any existing articles remain in the edX-
wide wiki, but the **Wiki** tab is removed from your course pages.

.. In XML authoring, remove the `{"type": "wiki"}` entry in your `/policies/TERM/policy.json` file.

.. _Controlling Wiki Access:

********************************
Controlling Access to the Wiki
********************************

You can control access to the wiki in various ways: by changing access to the
wiki as a whole, by changing the read/write permissions settings of articles
within the wiki, or by locking articles.

To change access to the course wiki:

#. Open your course in Studio.
#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.
#. Scroll down to the **Allow Public Access to Wiki** field. This Boolean setting is set to False by default, meaning that only course team members and enrolled students can see the course wiki. If you change the value of this field to True, then any registered edX user can access the course wiki, even if they are not enrolled in your course. However, public users would have to explicitly navigate to your wiki via the edX-wide wiki structure, or a link that has been provided to them.

To modify viewing or editing permissions for specific groups of users by
article, see :ref:`Setting Permissions for Wiki Articles`.

To lock an article and prevent further editing, see :ref:`Locking
a Wiki Article`.

.. _Setting Permissions for Wiki Articles:

***************************************
Setting Permissions for Wiki Articles
***************************************

To prevent certain groups of users from being able to add or edit articles, you
need to modify the read/write permissions for articles. For example, as a course
instructor, you likely want to prevent students from creating wiki articles at
the top level, so you should remove write access to course-level wiki articles
for most users. (Top-level wiki articles are children of the edX-wide wiki, and
cannot be found within the course wiki).

To modify the permissions for wiki articles, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.
#. Click **Wiki**.
#. Navigate to the article whose permissions you are modifying, then click **Settings**.
#. In the **Permissions** section of the **Settings** page, select or clear the checkboxes for read or write access for **Group** or **Other**.
#. At the bottom of the page, click the **Save changes** button for the **Permissions** section.
   
Note that there are two different **Save changes** buttons, one near the top of
the page for the **Notifications** section, and one at the bottom of the page
for the **Permissions** section. If you are modifying permissions, make sure you
click the **Save changes** button at the bottom of the page for your changes to
be saved.

===============================
Groups Used in Wiki Permissions
===============================

There are three groups for each course, managed by adding users to these groups
on the **Membership** page of the Instructor Dashboard:

	* Beta testers (by default there are no beta testers until you add them)
	* Instructors (by default, the course author is always in the instructor   group)
	* Staff (these are course team members)
  
The permissions for the **Others** group apply to users who are not in the three
course groups, including students.

.. If permissions are unchanged from the default wiki, students can create articles at the course level (children of the edX-wide wiki). This is easy to do accidentally due to the prominence of the Add article button for the top level.

.. _Seeding the Wiki:
  
********************************
Seeding the Wiki
********************************

To ensure that students get the most out of your course wiki, design the wiki
space before the course starts by seeding the course wiki with articles that
give it the desired structure.

For example, you could create wiki articles to mirror the course outline. At the
top level, you could provide a course outline, FAQs, and links to the main
articles for each section. In the child articles for each section, you could
provide information specific to the units and components in that section, and a
page for students to share their feedback and experiences.

.. _Locking a Wiki Article:

********************************
Locking a Wiki Article
********************************

Locking a wiki article prevents further changes from being made to it. Follow
these steps to lock a wiki article either after you create it, or after you make
specific edits.

.. If you only lock an article without modifying the read/write permissions,
.. other users can still create wiki articles at the top level. They also appear
.. still to have an Edit button at the top level, but they get Permission Denied
.. when they click Edit.

#. View the live version of your course.
#. Click **Wiki**.
#. Navigate to the article you want to lock, then click **Settings**.
#. In the **Permissions** section of the **Settings** page, select the **Lock article** checkbox.
#. At the bottom of the page, click the **Save changes** button for the **Permissions** section.

.. _Deleting a Wiki Article:

********************************
Deleting a Wiki Article
********************************

Only course team members can delete articles. In addition, you can only delete
an article if you have permissions to edit that article. If you have the
required permissions, you see a **Delete article** button at the bottom of the
**Edit** page.

Follow these steps to delete an article:

#. View the live version of your course.
#. Click **Wiki**.
#. Navigate to the article you want to delete, then click **Edit**.
#. Click **Delete article**.
#. On the deletion confirmation page, select **Yes, I am sure**.
#. Optionally, also select the **Purge** checkbox. For details, see :ref:`Purging a Wiki Article`.
#. Click **Delete article** to confirm the deletion.

   
.. _Purging a Wiki Article:   

========================
Purging a Wiki Article
========================

When you delete and purge an article, it is completely removed from the wiki,
with no option to undo the deletion. Select this option only if you are sure you
will not want to restore the content.

To purge an article as you delete it, select the **Purge** checkbox on the
deletion confirmation page.


.. _Restoring a Deleted Wiki Article:

=================================
Restoring a Deleted Wiki Article
=================================

Articles that have been deleted but not purged can be restored. A link to the
article remains visible at the level at which it was created. 

To restore a deleted article, click the link to the article and click
**Restore**.
