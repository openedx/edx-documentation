Course Launching Activities 
##############################

To launch a course, you prepare the course itself, the staff, and the
students. This chapter includes a :ref:`Course Launch Checklist` to use as a
model for your schedule of activities.

To help you communicate to the course staff or to all course participants before
the course launches and while it is running, you can send email messages from
the Instructor Dashboard. See :ref:`Bulk Email`. The chapter on bulk email also
includes a set of :ref:`example messages to students<Example Messages to
Students>` that you can use as guidelines when you write your own email
messages.

****************************
Course Launch Checklist
****************************

As the start date for your course approaches, a checklist or timeline of
activities can help you make sure that your course, and your students, are
ready to begin. Suggestions for activities to complete before your course
starts follow.

**Verify Course Settings**

* Check the course start date and time in Studio. See :ref:`Set Important
  Dates for Your Course`.
* Review the grading policy, and set a grace period for homework assignment
  due dates. See :ref:`Establish a Grading Policy`.
* Confirm that any optional features that you want your course to include, such
  as implementing student cohorts, are enabled and configured. See
  :ref:`Cohorts Overview`.

**Review First Week Content**

* Verify that all units are present and published. See :ref:`Developing Course
  Units`.
* Check all assignments for completeness and verify their due dates. See
  :ref:`Working with Problem Components`.
* Verify that videos, transcripts, and download links are in place and
  working.
* Review feedback from the course team and beta testers to be sure that the
  content has been thoroughly reviewed and tested.

**Welcome Students**

* Two months before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
  message to currently enrolled students. See :ref:`Prelaunch Reminder` and :ref:`Send_Bulk_Email`.
* Compose a welcome message and add it to the **Course Info** page. See
  :ref:`Add a Course Update`.
* Verify that a syllabus and other references are available on the **Course
  Handouts** page. See :ref:`Add Course Handouts`.
* One month before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
  message to currently enrolled students.
* One week before the course start date, prepare and send a welcome email
  message to currently enrolled students.
* Add an "Introduce Yourself" post to a discussion topic. For a MOOC, you may
  want to manage the size of the thread by distributing student responses
  across multiple threads. For example, you can start different threads for
  introductions based on geographical location, such as "Introduce Yourself:
  Europe", "Introduce Yourself: North America", etc. See
  :ref:`Running_discussions`.
* On the course start date, prepare and send a launch email message to
  currently enrolled students. See :ref:`Launch Day Welcome`. 

**Prepare Staff**

* Define communication methods for all course contributors, including staff,
  instructors, and the discussion team. For example, set up a course-specific
  email address.
* Verify that all course contributors know how to record their work, report
  issues, and collaborate on tasks.
* Verify that the instructors and course staff selected for your course
  have the correct role assignments in the LMS. See :ref:`Course_Staffing`.
* Verify that discussion admins, discussion moderators, and community TAs have
  registered and activated their user accounts, enrolled in the course, and
  been assigned their roles on the Instructor Dashboard. See
  :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
* Define methods for managing discussions and guidance for discussion
  moderators, and distribute to the discussion team. See
  :ref:`Moderating_discussions` and :ref:`Guidance for Discussion Moderators`.
