Developing Course Subsections
###################################

To develop subsections in your course, you must first understand the
following:

* `What is a Subsection?`_
* `Viewing Subsections in the Outline`_
* `The Student View of a Subsection`_
* `Subsections and Visibility to Students`_
* `Release Statuses of Subsections`_
  
Subsection tasks:

* `Create a Subsection`_
* `Change a Subsection Name`_
* `Set a Subsection Release Date`_
* `Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`_
* `Publish all Units in a Subsection`_
* `Hide a Subsection from Students`_
* `Delete a Subsection`_


****************************
What Is a Subsection?
****************************

Sections are divided into subsections, which in turn contain one or more units.
A subsection may represent a topic in your course, or another organizing
principle. Subsections are sometimes called “lessons” or “learning sequences.”


***********************************
Viewing Subsections in the Outline
***********************************

The following example shows three subsections in a section, all collapsed, in
the course outline:

 :alt: Three collapsed subsections in the outline


*********************************
The Student View of a Subsection
*********************************

Students see subsections in the Courseware tab, listed beneath the expanded
section. In the following example, seven subsections are circled, and the first
is open.

************************************************
Subsections and Visibility to Students
************************************************

Students cannot see any content in a subsection if the subsection's release
date is unscheduled or has not passed.

If a subsection's release date has passed, students can see content in the
subsection if the following three conditions are met:

* The release date of the parent section has passed.
* The units have been published.
* The units are not hidden from students.

************************************************
Release Statuses of Subsections
************************************************

As a course author, you control the release status of subsections.  For the
content of a subsection to be visible to students, the subsection must be
released. See the following for more information about the possible releases
statuses of subsections:

* `Scheduled with the Section`_
* `Unscheduled`_
* `Scheduled Later than the Section`_
* `Scheduled with Unpublished Changes`_
* `Released with Unpublished Changes`_
* `Released`_

==========================
Scheduled with the Section
==========================

When you create a subsection, it is set by default to release at the same time
as the section it is in. Therefore, published content in the subsection is
visible to students at the date and time the section is released.

The following example shows how an subsection in the Scheduled with Section
state is displayed in the outline, summarized with a green bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-scheduled.png
 :alt: A subsection scheduled to release with the section


========================
Unscheduled
========================

If the parent section is unscheduled, when you create a new subsection it
will also be unscheduled.

Regardless of the publishing status of units within the subsection, no content
in an unscheduled subsection is visible to students.

The following example shows how an unscheduled subsection is displayed in the
outline, summarized with a gray bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-unscheduled.png
 :alt: An unscheduled subsection

Content in the subsection is not visible to students until you set a release
date and the date passes.


===================================
Scheduled Later than the Section
===================================

You can set a subsection to release on a date after the section releases. 

Content in a subsection that is scheduled for release on a future date is not
visible to students, even if some or all of the units in the subsection are
published.

The following example shows the way that a subsection that will release after
its parent subsection appears in the course outline:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-scheduled-different.png
 :alt: A subsection scheduled to release later than the section

The scheduled date must pass for the subsection to be visible to students.

==================================
Scheduled with Unpublished Changes
==================================

You can make changes to a published unit before its parent subsection
is released. 

In this situation, when the release date for the subsection passes, the last
published version of units within the subsection are made visible to students.
The changes in units are not visible to students until you publish them.

The following example shows how a scheduled subsection with unpublished changes
is displayed in the outline, summarized with a yellow bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/section-scheduled-with-changes.png
 :alt: A scheduled subsection with unpublished changes


==================================
Released with Unpublished Changes
==================================

If you modify a unit within a released subsection, those modifications are not
visible to students until you publish them.

The following example shows how a released section that has unpublished changes
appears in the outline, summarized with a yellow bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/section-released-with-changes.png
 :alt: A released subsection with unpublished changes

===========================
Released
===========================

A subsection that is released is visible to students; however, students see
only units within the subsection that are published.

The following example shows how a released subsection is displayed in the
outline, summarized with a blue bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-released.png
 :alt: A released subsection

===========================
Staff Only Content
===========================

A subsection can contain a unit that is hidden from students and available to
staff only. That unit is not visible to students, even if the subsection has
been released.

The following example shows how an subsection that contains a unit that is
hidden from students is displayed in the outline, summarized with a black bar:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/section-hidden-unit.png
 :alt: A section with a hidden unit 

.. _Create a Subsection:

****************************
Create a Subsection
****************************

To create a new subsection:

#. In the outline, expand the section in which you want to create a new
   subsection.
#. Click **New Subsection** at the bottom of the expanded section. A new
   subsection is added at the end of the section, with the subsection name
   selected.
#. Enter the name for the new subsection. Remember that students see the
   subsection name in the courseware.
#. :ref:`Add units<Create a Unit>` to the new subsection as needed.
   
It is recommended that you :ref:`test course content <Testing Your Course
Content>` as you create new subsections.

********************************
Change a Subsection Name
********************************

To change a subsection name, click the Edit icon next to the subsection name.
The name field becomes editable. Enter the new name and tab or click out of the
field to save the name.

.. _Set a Subsection Release Date:

********************************

#. Click **Save**.

For more information, see :ref:`Release Dates`.

.. _Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection:

********************************************************
Set the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection
********************************************************

You set the assignment type for problems at the subsection level. 

When you set the assignment type for a subsection, all problems within the
subsection are graded and weighted as a single type.  For example, if you
designate the assignment type for a subsection as **Homework**, then all
problem types in that subsection are graded as homework.

To set the assignment type and due date for a subsection:

#. Click the Settings icon in the subsection box:
   
   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsections-settings-icon.png
    :alt: The subsection settings icon circled

   The Settings dialog box opens.

#. Select the assignment type for this subsection in the **Grade as** field:
   
   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-settings-grading.png
    :alt: The subsection settings with the assignment type and due date circled

#. Enter or select a due date and time for problems in this subsection.
#. Click **Save**.

For more information, see :ref:`Establish a Grading Policy`.

.. _Publish all Units in a Subsection:

**********************************
Publish all Units in a Subsection
**********************************

To publish all new and changed units in a subsection, click the publish icon in
the box for the subsection:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/outline-publish-icon-subsection.png
 :alt: Publishing icon for a subsection

.. note:: 
 The publish icon only appears when there is new or changed content within the
 subsection.

See :ref:`Unit Publishing Status` for information about statuses and visibility
to students.

.. _Hide a Subsection from Students:

********************************
Hide a Subsection from Students
********************************

You can hide all content in a subsection from students, regardless of the
status of units within the section.

To hide a subsection from students:

#. Click the Settings icon in the subsection box:
   
   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsections-settings-icon.png
    :alt: The subsection settings icon circled

   The **Settings** dialog box opens.

#. Check **Hide from students**.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-settings-hidden.png
    :alt: The subsection hide from students setting

#. Click **Save**.

Now, no content in the subsection is visible to students.

To make the subection visible to students, repeat these steps and clear the
**Hide from students** checkbox.

.. warning::
 When you clear the **Hide from students** checkbox for a subsection, not all
 content in the subsection is necessarily made visible to students. If you
 explicitly set a unit to be hidden from students, it remains hidden from
 students. Unpublished units remain unpublished, and changes to published units
 remain unpublished.

.. _Delete a Subsection:

********************************
Delete a Subsection
********************************

When you delete a subsection, you delete all units within the subsection.

.. warning::  
 You cannot restore course content after you delete it. To ensure you do not
 delete content you may need later, you can move any unused content to a
 section in your course that you set to never release.

To delete a subsection:

#. Click the delete icon in the subsection that you want to delete:

  .. image:: ../../../shared/building_running_course/Images/subsection-delete.png
   :alt: The subsection with Delete icon circled

2. When you receive the confirmation prompt, click **Yes, delete this
   subsection**.
