You can add PDF textbooks for your course.  

.. note::  Do not use image files (for example, .PNG files) as textbooks for
 your course, as they are not accessible to screen readers. Review the
 :ref:`Best Practices for Accessible PDFs` for more information.

Each textbook that you add is displayed to students as a tab in the course
navigation bar.

It's recommended that you upload a separate PDF file for each chapter of your
textbook.

When students open the textbook tab in the course, they can navigate the
textbook by chapter:
