Grading Remote Content
#####################################

When you include an edX problem component in an external LMS, learner responses
are graded by the edX system. Learner scores are then transferred back to the
external LMS. This exchange between an external LMS, the edX system, and back
to the external LMS is near real time. It can take a few moments to complete.

When you include edX problem components in an external LMS, note the
following requirements.

* The edX problem component must be in one of the graded subsections in your
  course.

* Your external LMS might also require that you use a specific part of the
  course for graded content. For example, in Canvas, you must add the LTI URL
  of a problem component to the "Assignments" section of a course, or to a
  module item that points to an assignment. In addition, the user who launches
  the LTI material must be eligible to get a grade for the assignment; that is,
  a learner and not a TA or course designer.

* The LTI URL that you construct for the external LMS must be for a single
  problem component. (In the edX LMS, **Check** appears once below each problem
  component.)
  
For more information about constructing an LTI URL for a course component, see
:ref:`Determining Content Addresses`.
