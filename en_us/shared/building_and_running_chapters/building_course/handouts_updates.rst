**********************
Add a Course Update
**********************

You add an update to notify learners of an upcoming exam or deadline, a change
in the course schedule, or make any other announcement that has a 
time-sensitive or urgent nature.

To add a course update, follow these steps.

#. From the **Content** menu, select **Updates**. 
#. Select **New Update**.
#. Enter your update in the HTML editor that opens.

    * You must use HTML to format your update. The :ref:`visual editor<The
      Visual Editor>` is not provided for course handouts.
    * If you change the supplied date, the new date appears above the update
      on the **Course Info** page. However, the update is visible to all
      enrolled learners as soon as you post it.

4. Optionally, choose whether to send a notification about your update to the
   edX mobile app. For the best experience on smartphones, your update should
   only include unformatted text.
#. Select **Post**. 
   
   Your update appears on the **Course Info** page in your course immediately.
   If selected, a push notification is sent to the mobile app.

.. _Add Course Handouts:

***************************

**Files & Uploads** page in another browser window to make this process
easier.

To identify a course handout, follow these steps.

#. From the **Content** menu, select **Updates**. 
#. In the **Course Handouts** panel, select **Edit**.
#. In the HRML editor that opens, use HTML formatting to add a link to the
   previously-uploaded file. For more information, see :ref:`Add a Link in an
   HTML Component`.
#. Select **Save**.
