Another way to create a course is to re-run an existing course. See
:ref:`Rerun a Course`.

You can also :ref:`Export a Course` and :ref:`Import a Course` through Studio.
You can do this when you need to edit the course in XML.


.. _Create a New Course:

*******************
Create a New Course
*******************

#. Log in to Studio.
#. Select **New Course**.
#. Enter course information as needed and select **Create**.

   .. note::  Enter new course information carefully. This information becomes
      part of the URL for your course. As part of your course URL, the total
      number of characters in the following four fields must be 65 or fewer.

   * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name
     may be "Sets, Maps, and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the
     course title.

   * For **Organization**, enter the identifier for your organization. Do not
     include spaces or special characters.


   * For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For
     example, for public health course number 207, enter **PH207**. For math
     course 101x, enter **Math101x**. Do not include spaces or special
     characters in the course number.

     .. note:: If your course will be open to the world, be sure to include the
        "x". If it is exclusively an on-campus offering, do not include the "x".*

   * For **Course Run**, enter the term in which your course will run. For
     example, enter 2014SOND or T2_2014. Do not include spaces or special
     characters.

     The value that you enter for the run does not affect the course start date
     that you define for the course. For more information, see :ref:`Scheduling
     Your Course`.

   .. only:: Partners

     .. note::
       For courses on edx.org and edX Edge, to change the URL after the course
       is created, you must contact edX through the `Partner Portal`_.

#. Select **Save.**

You then see the empty course outline.

.. _Edit Your Course:

************************
Edit Your Course
************************

After you create a course, the course opens in Studio automatically and you
can begin editing.

When you return to Studio later, the Studio **My Courses** dashboard page lists
the courses that you created as well as any courses for which you have course
team privileges.

To open a course, select the course name. The Studio **Course Outline** page
appears.

.. _Use the Course Checklist:

************************
Use the Course Checklist
************************

You can use a Course Checklist within Studio to help you work through the tasks
of building a course.

Categories of tasks in the Course Checklist include:

* Getting Started with Studio
* Draft a Rough Course Outline
* Explore edX's Support Tools
* Draft Your Course About Page

From the **Tools** menu, select **Checklists**.

As shown in the example above, for the **Add Course Team Members** task, if you
hover over a task, a button is displayed that takes you to the page to complete
that task.

You can expand and collapse the sections of the checklist as needed.

You can check tasks as you complete them. Studio saves your changes
automatically. Other members of the course team can see your changes.

.. _Add Course Team Members:

************************
Add Course Team Members
************************

Course team members are users who help you build your course. Before you can
assign Staff or Admin access to a team member, you must meet these
prerequisites.

* You must be an Admin.

* The team member that you want to add must register a user account and
  activate the account.

* You need the same, registered email address for the team member you want to
  add.

Other course team members can edit the course and perform all tasks except
adding and removing other team members and granting Admin access.

.. note::  Any course team member can delete content created by other team
 members.

To add a course team member:

#. Ensure you have Admin access.
#. Ensure that the new team member has registered and activated an account.
#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Course Team**.
#. Select **Add a New Team Member**.
#. Enter the new team member's email address, then select **ADD USER**.

The new team member can now work on the course in Studio.

* To preview the course in the LMS, the team member must enroll in the course.

* To moderate course discussions, the team member must also have one of the
  discussion roles. For more information, see
  :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

You can also assign privileged roles to users when you work in the LMS.

Regardless of where the role is assigned, these administrative team members can
work on your course in Studio immediately, and use the LMS and Insights after
enrollment. For more information about assigning roles while you run your
course, see :ref:`Course_Staffing`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but
they do not need to have Staff or Admin access. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
