Setting Details About Your Course
######################################################

This topic describes how to set details about your course in Studio. The
details you set affect the information learners see on their dashboards. For
more information, see :ref:`SFD Dashboard Settings Profile`.

.. contents:: Section Contents
  :local:
  :depth: 1

For information about setting important dates, see :ref:`Scheduling Your
Course`.

For information about setting the course license, see :ref:`Licensing a
Course`.

.. _The Course About Page:

***********************************
The Course About Page
***********************************

The following example shows the course About page. Learners can see the
About page before they enroll in the course, and may decide to enroll
based on the content of the page. 

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/about_page.png

 :width: 600

You configure the contents of this page in Studio, as described in this topic.

.. note:: Given the diversity of MOOC learners, be careful to clearly 
   communicate the target audience, level, and prerequisites for your course. 
   Aim for concrete, unambiguous words (for example, ``understand eigenvalue 
   decomposition`` rather than ``intermediate linear algebra``).


.. _The Learner Dashboard:

***********************************
The Learner Dashboard
***********************************

If a learner enrolls in your course, the course is then listed on the **Current
Courses** dashboard, with the course image. From the dashboard, a learner can
open a course that has started. If the course has not started, the learner can
see the start date, as explained in :ref:`Scheduling Your Course`.

     times.

.. _Describe Your Course:

************************
Describe Your Course
************************

Learners see the description of your course on the course About page.

For example, the course description is circled in the following course About
page.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/about-page-course-description.png
 :alt: Image of a course summary with the description circled.
 :width: 600

.. note:: For courses on edX.org, you must communicate the course description
 to your edX Partner Manager, to ensure the content is accurate on the course
 About page.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Introducing Your Course** section, then locate the
   **Course Overview** field.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/course_overview.png
    :alt: Image of the HTML course description.
    :width: 600

#. Overwrite the content as needed for your course, following the directions in
   the boilerplate text. Do not edit HTML tags. For a template that includes
   placeholders, see :ref:`A Template For Course Overview`.
 
#. Select **your course summary page** in the text beneath the field to test
   how the description will appear to learners.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have completed the course
   description.

.. _Add a Course Image:

************************
Add a Course Image
************************

The course image that you add in Studio appears on the dashboard. It should be
a minimum of 378 pixels in width by 225 pixels in height, and in .jpg or .png
format. Make sure the image that you upload maintains the aspect ratio of those
dimensions so that the image appears correctly on the dashboard.

In the following example, the course image that was added in Studio is circled
in the dashboard.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/dashboard-course-image.png
 :alt: Image of the course image in the dashboard.
 :width: 600

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Course Image** section.

#. To select an image from your computer, click **Upload Course Image**, then
   follow the prompts to find and upload your image.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have added the course image.

#. View your dashboard to test how the image will appear to learners.

.. note:: 
  On edX.org, the course image you add in Studio is used on the learner
  dashboard, but does not automatically appear on the course About page. Work
  directly with your edX Partner Manager to set up the About page assets and
  course image for the course summary page.

.. _Add a Course Video:

*********************************
Add a Course Video
*********************************

The course video appears on the course About page.

In the following example, the course video is circled in the course About
page:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/about-page-course-video.png
 :alt: Image of the course video in the course summary page.
 :width: 600

The course video should excite and entice potential learners to enroll, and
reveal some of the personality that the course team brings to the course.

The video should answer these key questions:

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or college is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

The video should deliver your message as concisely as possible and have a run
time of less than 2 minutes.

Ensure your course introduction video follows the same :ref:`Compression
Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as course content videos.

#. Upload the course video to YouTube. Make note of the code that appears
   between **watch?v =** and **&feature** in the URL. This code appears in the
   green box below.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/image127.png
    :alt: Image of a sample course video.
    
#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Course Introduction Video** section.

#. In the field below the video box, enter the YouTube video ID (the code you
   copied in step 1). When you add the code, the video automatically loads in
   the video box.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have added the course video.

#. View your course About page to test how the video will appear to learners.

.. note:: 
  On edX.org, you work directly with your Partner Manager to set up the course
  video in the summary page.

.. _Set Course Effort Expectations:

*******************************
Set Course Effort Expectations
*******************************

The estimated effort the course requires appears in the course About page. 

You set the hours and minutes a week estimate in Studio.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Schedule & Details**.

#. Scroll down to the **Requirements** section.

#. In the **Hours of Effort per Week** field, enter the number of hours you
   expect learners to work on this course each week.

#. When you make changes, a **Save Changes** button appears at the bottom right
   of the page. Select **Save Changes** when you have added the estimated
   effort.

#. View your course About page to test how the requirements will appear to
   learners.
