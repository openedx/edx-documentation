Create a certificate

#. In Studio, select **Settings**  > **Certificates**.

#. Select **Add a new certificate**.

#. Optionally, specify a shorter course name to use on the certificate, if the
   official course name is too long to display well.

#. Upload the logo image file for your organization. Make sure that this is
   the approved official logo for your organization, for consistency with
   certificates that are issued from other courses in your organization.

.. note:: Images that you upload for certificates can be a maximum of 10MB in
   size and must not exceed the dimensions indicated below the upload path field.

#. Add a signatory for each person associated with the course or organization
   that you want to have appear on the certificate, up to a maximum of 4
   signatories. You must have at least one signatory for a certificate.

#. If you offer verified certificates in your course, you can upload image
   files showing the signature for each signatory. Signatory images are used
   only for verified certificates; honor certificates show only the names of
   signatories, not their signatures.

#. When you have finished editing your certificate select the course mode then
   select **Preview** to view the certificate as it will appear to a learner
   taking the course in the selected mode.

.. note:: Images that you upload for certificates can be a maximum of 10MB in
   size and must not exceed the dimensions indicated below the upload path field.

#. When you are satisfied that the certificate details are as they should
   appear, click **Activate**.

   Activated certificates are available for viewing by learners and course
   staff. You can edit activated certificates, but if you make and save any
   changes, the certificate becomes inactive. You must activate it again
   before it can be issued.


.. _Edit a Certificate:

************************
Edit a Certificate
************************

You can edit a certificate at any time, including after a certificate has been activated, but as a best practice you should not make changes to certificates after a course has started and if it is possible that the certificate has already been issued to learners.

To make changes to a certificate configuration, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings** > **Certificates**.

#. In the certificate configuration, select the **Edit** icon and make your
   changes.

#. When you have finished editing the certificate configuration, click
   **Save**.

   After you save your changes, you should **Preview** the certificate to make
   sure it appears as you want it to. You then need to click **Activate** to
   re-activate the certificate.

Preview a Certificate

When a certificate has been approved, course team members can preview it for
verification purposes.

#. In Studio, select Settings > Certificates.

#. On the certificates configuration page, click Preview, then select the
   course mode of the certificate you want to preview.

   You see the web view for the certificate, as a learner in the selected
   course mode would see it.

#. If necessary, on the certificates configuration page, select Edit.

#. Make any changes and select **Save**.

#. Click Preview to see your changes.



.. _Approve a Certificate:

************************
Approve a Certificate
************************

When the course certificate is ready to be issued, on the certificates
configuration page in Studio click **Approve**. 

The certificate configuration can be edited, but if you save any changes, the
certificate must be approved again.

If you must make further changes after you approve a certificate you must re-approve it after saving your changes.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but
they do not need to have Staff or Admin access. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
