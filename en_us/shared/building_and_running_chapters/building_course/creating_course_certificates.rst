*********************

Create a certificate

#. In Studio, select **Settings**  > **Certificates**.

#. Select **Add a new certificate**.

#. If the official course name is too long to display well on a certificate,
   you can optionally specify a shorter course name to use on the certificate.

#. Upload the logo for your organization. Make sure that this is the same
   standardized logo used across all courses for your organization. Make sure
   it is the approved and official version that other courses in your
   organization are using, for consistency across certificates that are issued
   from other courses in your organization.

#. Add a signatory for each person associated with the course or organization
   that you want to have appear on the certificate, up to a maximum of 4
   signatories. You must have at least one signatory for a certificate.

#. If you offer verified certificates in your course, you can upload image
   files showing the signature for each signatory. Signatory images are used
   only for verified certificates; honor certificates show only the names of
   signatories, not their signatures.

#. When you have finished editing your certification click “Preview” and
   select the course mode to view the certificate as it will appear to a
   learner taking the course in the selected mode.

#. When you are satisfied that the certificate details are as they should
   appear, click **Approved**.

   Approved certificates are available for viewing by learners and for
   previewing by course team members.

.. _Add Course Team Members:

Add Course Team Members
************************

Course team members are users who help you build your course. Before you can
assign Staff or Admin access to a team member:

* You must be an Admin.

* The team member that you want to add must register a user account and
  activate the account.

* You need the same, registered email address for the team member you want to
  add.

Other course team members can edit the course and perform all tasks except
adding and removing other team members and granting Admin access.

.. note::  Any course team member can delete content created by other team
 members.

To add a course team member:

#. Ensure you have Admin access.
#. Ensure that the new team member has registered and activated an account.
#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Course Team**.
#. Select **Add a New Team Member**.
#. Enter the new team member's email address, then select **ADD USER**. 

The new team member can now work on the course in Studio. 

* To preview the course in the LMS, the team member must enroll in the course.

* To moderate course discussions, the team member must also have one of the
  discussion roles. For more information, see
  :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

You can also assign privileged roles to users when you work in the LMS.

.. note:: The LMS "Course Staff" role is the same as the Studio "Staff" role, 
 and the LMS "Instructors" role is the same as the Studio "Admin" role.

Regardless of where the role is assigned, these administrative team members
can work on your course in both Studio and the LMS (after enrollment). For
more information about assigning roles while you run your course, see
:ref:`Course_Staffing`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course and to
moderate and manage its discussions by assigning other LMS roles. The beta
testers and discussion administrators must be enrolled in your course, but
they do not need to have Staff or Admin access. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.
