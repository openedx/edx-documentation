.. _Create a Certificate:
  
*********************
Create a Certificate
*********************

You create one certificate per course that serves as the template for all
course modes. Honor code certificates use the organization logo and signatory
information, but does not include signature images, which are used only for
verified certificates.

To create a certificate for your course, follow these steps. 

#. In Studio, select **Settings**  > **Certificates**.

#. Select **Add a new certificate**.

#. Optionally, specify a shorter course name to use on the certificate, if the
   official course name is too long to display well.

.. Max character legnth for course name?   

#. Upload the logo image file for your organization. Make sure that this is
   the approved official logo for your organization, for consistency with
   certificates that are issued by other courses in your organization.

.. note:: Images that you upload for certificates can be a maximum of 10MB in
   size and must not exceed the dimensions indicated below the upload path field.

#. Add a signatory for each person associated with the course or organization
   that you want to have appear on the certificate, up to a maximum of 4
   signatories. You must have at least one signatory for a certificate.

#. If you offer verified certificates in your course, you can upload image
   files showing the signature for each signatory. Signature images are used
   only for verified certificates; honor certificates show only the names of
   signatories, without signatures.


.. note:: Images that you upload for certificates can be a maximum of 10MB in
   size and must not exceed the dimensions indicated below the upload path field.

.. _Edit a Certificate:

************************
Edit a Certificate
************************

You can edit a certificate at any time, including after a certificate has been
activated. However, as a best practice you should not make changes to
certificates after a course has started and if it is possible that the
certificate has already been issued to learners.

To make changes to a certificate, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings** > **Certificates**.

#. In the certificate configuration, select the **Edit** icon and make your
   changes.

#. When you have finished editing the certificate configuration, click
   **Save**.

   After you save your changes, you should :ref:`preview the
   certificate<Preview a Certificate>` to make sure it appears as you want it
   to. You then need to click **Activate** to reactivate the certificate.
