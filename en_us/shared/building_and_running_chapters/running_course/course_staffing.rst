About the Course Team Roles
**************************************

To give team members access to Studio, the Instructor Dashboard in the LMS, and
Insights, you assign one of these course team roles to them.

* Staff

* Admin

You can assign these privileged roles when you work in either the LMS or
Studio. The people who have these roles can work on your course in Studio, the
LMS, and Insights. For more information about assigning roles to team members
in Studio, see :ref:`Add Course Team Members`.

You can also designate teams of people to beta test your course or to moderate
and manage its discussions by assigning other roles in the LMS. Beta testers
and discussion team members must be enrolled in your course, but they do not
need to have the Staff or Admin role. For more information, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing` and :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

****************************
