###############################################
Participating in Course Discussions
###############################################

Course discussions give you the opportunity to start conversations with other
learners, ask questions of the course team, and participate in the course
community. If you have not previously participated in an online discussion
forum, see the introductory :ref:`"anatomy"<Anatomy of edX Course Discussions>`
section.

This chapter also describes features of edX discussions that can make your
participation more effective. These include ways to:

* :ref:`Find Posts`

* :ref:`Add a Post`

* :ref:`Keep Up with New Activity`

* :ref:`React to Contributions`

.. _Anatomy of edX Course Discussions:

**********************************
Anatomy of edX Course Discussions 
**********************************

====================================
Posts, Responses, and Comments
====================================

::

  Post: "Please introduce yourself."
    - Response: "My name is Lee and I teach secondary school maths in Canberra,
      Australia."
    - Response: "Hello everyone, I am Sumei from Hong Kong, China."
      - Comment: "Hi Sumei, I am taking this course in Hong Kong too. Maybe we
        should make a study group!"
      - Comment: "I'd like to join the Hong Kong study group too, I think it
        will help me keep up with the homework."
    - Response: "Hi from Johannesburg! I am taking the course to prepare for my
      matric exams."

This example shows the different ways that you can contribute to a discussion.
The post initiates the conversation, the responses are replies to the post, and
the comments expand on specific responses. Before you add a post, response, or
comment, take a moment to consider which of these options best suits the
contribution that you want to make. This helps keep course discussions
organized and easy to follow.

====================================
Discussion Topics
====================================

Most edX courses include opportunities to discuss specific video lectures,
reading assignments, homework problems, or other course content. Each of these
content-specific discussion opportunities is called a *topic*. When these
discussion topics are included in a course, they typically appear below the
content they apply to.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_content_specific.png
 :alt: A discussion topic that appears below a video in the course, identified 
       by a "Show Discussion" link.

Most courses also include one or more topics for course-wide discussions, such
as "Frequently Asked Questions" and "Troubleshooting". You access these topics
on the **Discussion** page of the course: select the **All Discussions**
drop-down.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_course_wide.png
 :alt: Discussion topics are listed on the Discussion page when you select the 
       drop-down list at the left side of the page.

When you visit the **Discussion** page, you can read and add to any of the
discussion topics. 

* Course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them.

* Content-specific topics are indented under an identifying category name. 

Notice that you can access content-specific topics both on the **Discussion**
page and also while you are navigating through course content on the
**Courseware** page. However, you can only access the course-wide topics on the
**Discussion** page.

Before you add a post, look through the topics. When you add your post to the
most appropriate topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and
respond to it more easily.

====================================
Types of Discussion Posts
====================================

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post
as either a question or a discussion.

* A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion
  administration team and the course community can provide answers.

* A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections,
  and inviting community participation.

When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a question
or a discussion. 

After you make your post, on the **Discussion** page for your course, a
question mark image identifies posts that ask questions and a conversation
bubble image identifies posts that start discussions.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Post_types_in_list.png
 :alt: The list of posts with images identifying questions and discussions.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion). If you require an answer from the
course team, be sure to create your post as a question, so that the course
team sees that a response is required and responds appropriately.


.. _Find Posts:

******************************
Find Posts
******************************

Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the same subject that interests you, and then
reading and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps
make the time that everyone spends with the course discussion more productive.
You can search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a
single discussion topic.

=======================
Search the Discussions
=======================

To search for text, select **Discussion**, and then enter a phrase, a word, or
part of a word in the **Search all posts** field above the list of posts. When
you press Enter, the search tries to find:

* A match or close match to your text in any post, response, or comment. The
  display updates to show a list of the posts that have a match at any level of
  interaction.

* A similar value in any post, response, or comment (if no exact matches are
  found). A "No results found for {text}. Showing results for {similar}"
  message displays above the posts that have similar text at any interaction
  level.

* Any usernames that are an exact match to your text. A "Show posts by
  {username}" option displays above any posts that have an exact text match at
  any interaction level. Select the username in the message to read that user's
  posts, responses, and comments.

==============================================
Review Posts About a Single Topic
==============================================

To review posts about a particular part of the course or type of issue, select
**Discussion** at the top of the page and then select a topic from the drop-
down list. (**All Discussions** is selected by default.) Only posts about the
topic you select appear in the list of posts.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_filters.png
 :alt: The list of posts with callouts to identify the top filter to select 
       one topic and the filter below it to select by state.

=======================================
Review Only Unread or Unanswered Posts
=======================================

To limit the posts shown on the **Discussion** page, you can select one of the
filter options. Above the list of posts, the **Show all** filter is selected
by default.

* To list only the discussions and questions that you have not yet viewed,
  select **Unread**.

* To list only question posts that do not yet have any responses marked as
  answers, select **Unanswered**.

.. _Keep Up with New Activity:

****************************************
Keep Up with New Activity
****************************************

==============================
Read New or Updated Posts
==============================

The list of posts on the **Discussion** page provides visual cues to help you
identify posts that are new, or that have responses or comments that you have
not read yet, and to distinguish them from exchanges that you have already read
completely.

* Posts that you have not read yet have a blue callout image.

* Posts that you have read, but with responses or comments that you have not
  read yet, have a white callout image.
 
* Exchanges that you have read completely have a gray callout image and
  background.

 .. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_colorcoding.png
  :alt: The list of posts with posts showing differently colored backgrounds 
        and callout images.

The total number of contributions in the exchange (the post and its responses
and comments) appears in each callout image. To see the number of contributions
that you haven't read yet, move your cursor over the callout image.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_mouseover.png
 :alt: A post with four contributions total, and a popup that shows that only
   two are unread.

The color-coded callout images appear when you sort the list of posts **by
recent activity** or **by most activity**. If you sort the list of posts by
most votes instead, the number of votes that the post has received appears in
place of the callouts. For more information, see :ref:`Vote for Posts or
Responses`.

==============================
Receive Daily Digests
==============================

You have the option to receive an email message each day that summarizes
discussion activity for the posts you are following. To receive this daily
digest, select **Discussion** and then select the **Receive updates** checkbox.


.. _React to Contributions:

************************************
Provide Feedback on Contributions
************************************

As you read the contributions that other learners and team members make to
discussion topics, you can provide feedback without writing a complete response
or comment. You can provide feedback in these ways.

* :ref:`Vote for posts and responses<Vote for Posts or Responses>` to provide
  positive feedback.

* :ref:`Follow posts<Follow Posts>` so that you can check back in on
  interesting conversations and questions easily.

* :ref:`Answer questions, and mark your questions as answered<Answer
  Questions>`.

* :ref:`Report a contribution<Report Discussion Misuse>` that is inappropriate
  to the discussion administration team.

To select a feedback option, you use the icons at the top right of each post,
response, or comment. When you move your cursor over these icons a label
appears.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_options_mouseover.png
 :alt: The icons at top right of a post, shown before the cursor is 
      placed over each one and with the Vote, Follow, and More labels.

When you select the "More" icon, a menu of the options that currently apply
appears.

post or response and select the "Vote" icon at top right.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_vote.png
 :alt: A post with the Vote icon circled.

You can sort the list of posts so that the posts with the most votes appear at
the top: select the drop-down list of sorting options and select **by most
votes**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_sortvotes.png
 :alt: The list of posts with the "by most votes" sorting option and the 
       number of votes for the post circled.

The number of votes that each post has received displays in the list of posts.
(Votes for responses are not included in the number.)

.. _Follow Posts:

==============================
Follow Posts
==============================

If you find a post particularly interesting and want to return to it in the
future, you can follow it: view that post and select the "Follow" icon.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_follow.png
 :alt: A post with the Follow icon circled.

Each post that you follow appears with a "Following" indicator in the list of
posts.

To list only the posts that you are following, regardless of the discussion
topic they apply to, select the drop-down Discussion list and select
**Posts I'm Following**.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_filterfollowing.png
 :alt: The list of posts with the "Posts I'm Following" filter selected. Every
       post in the list shows the following indicator.

.. _Answer Questions:

============================================================
Answer Questions and Mark Questions as Answered 
============================================================

Anyone in a course can answer questions. Just add a response to the question
post with your answer.

The person who posted the question (and members of the discussion
administration team) can mark responses as correct: select the "Mark as Answer"
icon that appears at upper right of the response.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/Discussion_answer_question.png

.. only:: Open_edX

  .. note:: You can only mark questions as answered when you work in a web
    browser. This option is not available when you work in an edX mobile app.

After at least one response is marked as the answer, a check or tick mark image
replaces the question mark image for the post in the list on the **Discussion**
page.
