****************************
Proctored Exam Overview
****************************

To earn credit for completing a course, students must achieve a passing grade
in the course as well as receive a Pass result for a proctoring session that
is conducted as they take an examination that is designated as a proctored
exam. Proctored exams must also be timed exams.

Online proctoring software checks that the person taking the exam is the same
person who is taking the course for credit, and also detects any attempts to
cheat on the exam. Students who agree to take an exam with online proctoring
must install the proctoring software and perform a series of checks on their
computer and test environment and must also provide photo identification
before being allowed to proceed. The proctoring software then runs in the
background, monitoring the test environment and screen activity as the student
takes the exam.

When the student completes the exam, either by submitting their answers or
when the time expires for the exam, proctoring data is uploaded to the third
party proctoring service provider. This data is reviewed for adherence to
edX's Online Proctoring Rules (ADD LINK), and when the review is complete, a
Pass or Fail result is returned for each student who took the exam as a
proctored exam.

.. Need to verify how course staff check proctoring results for students.

.. For passing students, is there some visible status change for certificates etc. that is triggered to indicate that they can go ahead with requesting credit? Anything visible in the UI?

==============================================
The Student Experience of Proctored Exams
==============================================

Only students who have signed up for the verified track in your course have the
option of taking proctored exams. When they access a proctored exam, students
on the verified track have the choice of taking the exam with online
proctoring, or of taking the exam without proctoring and only as a timed exam.

If students choose to take the exam without proctoring, they are not eligible
for credit for the exam, and will not be offered the proctored option for that
exam again.

If students are not ready to make the choice or to the exam right now, they
can return to it any time before the due date.

.. Do we want to give advice to course staff about planning an adequate due date? e.g. allow more time than normal for administrative tasks, especially as edX support needs to be involved in tasks such as creating extra time allowances. Course staff need to allow enough time to get confirmations back from Support and also to notify students. If resolution of any technical difficulty disputes is needed, students also need adequate time to retake the exam.

.. How does the due date interact with the proctoring review process.

Students who accept the choice to take the exam with online proctoring are
guided through steps to install the software and perform system and user
checks, including ID verification, in a new window that is opened by the
proctoring software. For details, see (REF to STUDENT doc)

Once the student successfully completes the checks, the proctoring session starts. The
student is reminded not to close the proctoring software window and is
prompted to return to the browser window where the courseware is open, and
start taking the exam.

A countdown timer is visible at the top of the courseware page during the
exam. Warnings are displayed when there is 20% and 5% of allotted time
remaining.

When a student completes the exam, or when the countdown timer reaches 00:00,
the student no longer has access to the exam. The proctoring software begins
the process of uploading the captured session data. Students are notified of
this and see a status of "Pending" for their proctoring session results.


====================================================
Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams
====================================================

Well before the exam is due, provide information about the grading policy of
your course, and make it clear what the requirements are for earning credit.

Explain what proctored exams are, and provide students with these links to
documentation about proctored exams in the Learner's Guide, and to edX's
Online Proctoring Rules. Emphasize that students must be aware of the
requirements before taking the exam, and that some of the requirements might
take some preparation. 

When learner agree to take the proctored exam and start the process of
installing the proctoring software, they must continue through to taking the
exam as soon as that process is completed.

The following list represents only some of the requirements listed in the
Online Proctoring Rules.

* System and environment checks that students are asked to perform for the
  proctoring session include taking a photo of a government-issued photo ID,
  and a photo of themselves, using the webcam on their computer. In addition,
  they must use the webcam to provide a room scan that includes the desk area,
  the area under their desk, and a view around the whole room.

* Students must sit at a clean desk or table that has been cleared of all
  materials such as phones, books, notebooks, pens, and papers. They cannot
  sit on a bed or couch to take the proctored exam.

* No writing can be visible on the desk or walls in the test environment.

* The computer on which the student takes the exam must not have a secondary
  monitor connected.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, the student cannot leave the room
  for any reason.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, no other person can enter the room
  for any reason.

* The student cannot talk to anyone or communicate by any means with another
  person during the exam.

* Students cannot have music or the television playing in the background during
  the exam. They cannot use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of
  listening equipment.


Practice Proctored Exams
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A practice proctored exam is available in the example course. Students will
have a chance to experience the proctoring setup as well as the experience of
taking the exam under timed conditions.

.. note:: Even if they perform the proctoring setup for the practice exam,
   students will be prompted to install the proctoring software again when
   they take the actual proctored exam, to make sure they have the latest version.
