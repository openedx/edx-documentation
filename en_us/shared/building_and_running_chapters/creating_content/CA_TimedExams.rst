Timed Exam Overview
****************************

Course teams can create exams that have a time limit for completion. 

For information about creating timed exams in Studio, see :ref:`Create a
Timed or Proctored Exam`.

In some situations, for example to accommodate learners with disabilities, you
can allow a specific learner more time to complete a timed exam. For
information, see :ref:`Requests for Additional Time`.

==============================================
The Learner Experience of Timed Exams
==============================================

Taking a timed exam is the same for a learner as taking any other exam in a
course, except that a countdown timer is visible at the top of the courseware
page during the exam. Warnings are displayed when there is 20% and 5% of
allotted time remaining.

When learners complete the exam, or when the countdown timer reaches 00:00,
they no longer have access to the exam. Answers that they have completed are
submitted for grading.
