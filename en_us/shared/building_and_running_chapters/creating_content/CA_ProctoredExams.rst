****************************
Proctored Exam Overview
****************************

In for-credit courses, course teams can create exams that they designate as
proctored exams. Learners in the Verified track can choose to take the exam as
proctored and be eligible for course credit, or take the exam as a non-
proctored exam and not be eligible for course credit. For more information
about creating proctored exams in Studio, see :ref:`Create a Timed or
Proctored Exam`.

To earn credit for completing a course, learners take the exam as a proctored
exam and must receive a passing result for their online proctoring session in
addition to achieving a passing score in the course.

For information about for-credit courses and specifying the passing score, see
:ref:`Offering Academic Course Credit` and :ref:`Specify Passing Score`.


=====================================================
Learner Requirements for Taking Proctored Exams
=====================================================

Learners who agree to take an exam with online proctoring must install
proctoring software, which checks that the person taking the exam is the same
person who is taking the course for credit, and also detects any attempts to
cheat on the exam. Learners perform a series of checks on their computer and
test environment and must also provide photo identification before being
allowed to proceed. The proctoring software then runs in the background,
monitoring the test environment and screen activity as the learner takes the
exam.

For more information about the technical requirements for taking a proctored
exam, and edX's Online Proctoring Rules, see :ref:`Preparing Learners for
Proctored Exams`.

===============================
Proctored Exam Session Results
===============================

When learners complete a proctored exam, either by submitting their answers or
when the time expires for the exam, proctoring data is uploaded to the third
party proctoring service provider. This data is reviewed for adherence to
edX's Online Proctoring Rules :ref:(ADD LINK), and when the review is complete, a
Pass or Fail result is returned for each learner who took the exam as a
proctored exam.

.. Verify how course staff check proctoring results for students.

When proctoring session results become available, course staff can download a
report that lists proctoring results for learners in their course. For more
information, see :ref:`Reviewing Proctoring Results for Learners`.

.. For passing students, is there some visible status change for certificates
.. etc. that is triggered to indicate that they can go ahead with requesting
.. credit? Anything visible in the UI?

Learners who have achieved passing grades in the course as well as Pass
results for the proctored exam are shown as eligible for credit on their
Progress pages.

.. _CA_LearnerExperience_Proctored Exams:

==============================================
The Learner Experience of Proctored Exams
==============================================

Only learners who have signed up for the Verified track in your course have
the option of taking proctored exams. When they access a proctored exam,
learners on the Verified track can choose to take the exam with online
proctoring, or to take the exam without proctoring and only as a timed exam.

If learners choose to take the exam without proctoring, they are not eligible
for credit for the exam, and will not be offered the proctored option for that
exam again.

Learners who are not ready to make the choice or take the exam immediately can
defer their decision and return to the exam again at some other time before
the due date.

.. Do we want to give advice to course staff about planning an adequate due date? 
.. e.g. allow more time than normal for allow proctoring results to come back? Allow time for administrative tasks, especially as edX support needs to be involved in creating extra time allowances. Course staff need to allow enough time to get confirmations back from Support and also to notify students. If resolution of any technical difficulty disputes is needed, students also need adequate time to retake the exam.

When learners agree to take the exam with online proctoring, they are guided
through the process of installing the proctoring software and performing
system and user checks, including ID verification. They must be ready to take
the exam as soon as the proctoring session setup is completed. For details,
see :ref:`SFD_Before_Taking_Proctored_Exam`_ in the *edX Learner's Guide*.

After learners successfully complete the checks, the proctoring session starts.
Learners are reminded not to close the proctoring software window. They are
prompted to return to the browser window where the courseware is open, and to
start taking the exam.

A countdown timer is visible at the top of the courseware page during the
exam. Warnings are displayed when there is 20% and 5% of allotted time
remaining.

When learners complete the exam, or when the countdown timer reaches 00:00,
they no longer have access to the exam. The proctoring software begins the
process of uploading the captured session data. Learners are notified of this
and see a status of "Pending" for their proctoring session results. They can
check their Progress pages in the LMS for updates to the proctoring review
results. If they receive a passing result for proctoring as well as passing
grades for the course, they are shown as being eligible for credit on their
Progress page.

For information about scenarios that learners might encounter, see
:ref:`Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams` and
:ref:`CA_Situations_Learners_Encounter_Proctored_Exams`.


.. _Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams:

====================================================
Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams
====================================================

Well before the exam is due, provide learners with information about the
grading policy of your course, and make it clear what the requirements are for
earning credit.

Explain what proctored exams are, and provide learners with links to the
Learner's Guide topics about proctored exams, and to edX's :ref:`Online
Proctoring Rules <Online Proctoring Rules>`. Emphasize that learners must be
aware of the requirements before taking the exam, and that some of the
requirements might take some preparation.

.. note:: When learners agree to the exam with online proctoring and start the
   process of installing the proctoring software, they must continue through
   to taking the exam as soon as that process is completed.

The following list represents only some of the requirements listed in the
:ref:`Online Proctoring Rules <Online Proctoring Rules>`.

* System and environment checks that learners are asked to perform for the
  proctoring session include taking a photo of a government-issued photo ID,
  and a photo of themselves, using the webcam on their computer. In addition,
  they must use the webcam to provide a room scan that includes the desk area,
  the area under their desk, and a view around the whole room.

* Learners must sit at a clean desk or table that has been cleared of all
  materials such as phones, books, notebooks, pens, and papers. They cannot
  sit on a bed or couch to take the proctored exam.

* No writing can be visible on the desk or walls in the test environment.

* The computer on which a learner takes the exam must not have a secondary
  monitor connected.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, the learner cannot leave the room
  for any reason.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, no other person can enter the room
  for any reason.

* The learner cannot talk to anyone or communicate by any means with another
  person during the exam.

* Learners cannot have music or the television playing in the background during
  the exam. They cannot use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of
  listening equipment.

Responding to Learners' Concerns about Proctored Exams
**********************************************************

In addition to questions that can be answered in the FAQs on edx.org, or by
the :ref:`Online Proctoring Rules <Online Proctoring Rules>`, situations might
arise that require an action by edX Support.

.. _Requests for Additional Time:

===================================
Handle Requests for Additional Time 
===================================

In some situations, for example to accommodate learners with disabilities,
additional time allowances can be provided for specific students. Consult with
your organization's Disability Services resources to decide whether and how a
learner with specific needs can be accommodated for a timed exam.

If it is confirmed that additional time should be allowed for a specific
student to take the exam, follow these steps.

#. Contact edX Support to ask them to set up a time allowance for the learner.

#. Provide edX Support with the learner's username or email address, and the
   amount of additional time that this learner should be allowed to complete
   the exam.

#. When the allowance has been set up, let the learner know their adjusted
   allowed time for the exam.

   When this learner starts taking the exam, the exam timer takes into account
   the adjusted time.


.. _Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam:

=====================================================
Handle Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam
=====================================================

Course teams might have to manage situations where learners experienced
technical difficulties with online proctoring, or other reasons for requesting
a chance to retake a proctored exam. 

.. note:: Deleting a learner's exam attempt clears all submitted answers, and
   the learner experiences the exam as if for the first time, including making
   the choice to take the exam with online proctoring, obtaining an exam code,
   going through the proctoring software setup, and so on.

If a learner's request for retaking a proctored exam is valid, and you want to
delete the record of their exam attempt so that they can retake the exam,
follow these steps.

#. Contact edX Support to ask them to delete the exam attempt for the learner.

#. Provide edX Support with the learner's username or email address.

#. When the exam attempt has been deleted, let the learner know that they can
   retake the exam.


.. _CA_Situations_Learners_Encounter_Proctored_Exams:

**********************************************************
Situations that Learners Might Encounter
**********************************************************

This section provides information about scenarios that learners might
encounter while they take proctored exams. In general, course teams will have
to decide how to proceed on a case by case basis.

=========================================================
Navigating to Another Part of the Course During an Exam
=========================================================

While they are taking a timed or proctored exam, learners can navigate (using
the same browser session) to other parts of your course.

.. note:: It is a violation of edX's Online Proctoring Rules for learners to
   navigate to websites other than edX.org during the proctored exam.

If learners navigate to other parts of your course, they see an alert message
indicating that the timer on their exam continues to count down. When learners
return to the exam, they resume where they left the exam. The timer has been
continuing to count down during the learner's time away from the exam.


==========================================
Running Out Of Time In an Exam
==========================================

If the timer reaches 00.00 before a learner has completed the exam, all the
answers that the learner has submitted up to that point in time are submitted
for grading.

If the exam is also a proctored exam, the proctoring session automatically
ends when the exam ends, and the proctoring session data is uploaded for review. 

.. Is this true that the proctoring session automatically ends?


=======================================================
Closing a Browser Window Before The End of the Exam
=======================================================

If a learner closes either the proctoring software window or the edx.org
browser window while a proctored exam is in progress, they see an alert
message warning them that they are ending their exam. If they continue to
close either of the windows, both the exam and the proctoring session end. 

In general, answers in the exam up to the point that the session ended are submitted for grading, but the proctoring session recording might not be completely uploaded. 

If either the proctoring software or the exam window terminate unexpectedly
due to a system error rather than a learner action, the alert message might
not be shown, but the results in terms of the answer submission and the
proctoring session upload are the same.

Course team members will have to decide whether the exam results that were
obtained are valid, or whether the exam attempt should be cleared and the
learner given an opportunity to retake the exam. For more information, see
:ref:`Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam`.
