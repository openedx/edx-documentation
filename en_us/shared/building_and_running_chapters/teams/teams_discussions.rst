Managing Team Discussions 
#########################

You should designate course staff and optionally student TAs to moderate team
discussions. As in course discussions, different roles have different
privileges in team discussions.

.. note:: The members of the course team that you set up in Studio or on the
   Instructor Dashboard in the LMS are not automatically granted discussion
   administration roles.

   Discussion administration roles must be explicitly granted to members of the
   course team for them to be able to moderate or administer course discussions.
   The course author and any team members who have the Admin role can grant
   discussion administration roles.

For information about discussion administration roles, see
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. For information about managing discussions,
see :ref:`Running_discussions`.
