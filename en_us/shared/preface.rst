Learners, course teams, researchers, developers: the edX community includes
groups with a range of reasons for using the platform and objectives to
accomplish. To help members of each group learn about what edX offers, reach
goals, and solve problems, edX provides a variety of information resources.

To help you find what you need, browse the edX offerings in the following
categories.

 :depth: 1

All members of the edX community are encouraged to make use of the
resources described in this preface. We welcome your feedback on these edX
information resources. Contact the edX documentation team at `docs@edx.org`_.

.. _Resources for Students:

******************************
Resources for edx.org Learners
******************************

==============
Documentation
==============

The `edX Help Center for Learners`_ includes topics to help you understand how
to use the edX learning management system. The Help Center is also available 
when you select **Help** while you are in a course, and from your edX dashboard.

==============
In a Course
==============

If you have a question about something you encounter in an edX course, try
these options for getting an answer.

.. note::
  If you find an error or mistake in a course, contact the course staff by
  adding a post in the :ref:`course discussions<Explore Posts>`.

* Check the **Course** page in the course. Course teams use this page to post
  updates about the course, which can include explanations about course
  content, reminders about when graded assignments are due, or announcements
  for upcoming events or milestones.

* Look for an "Introduction", "Overview", or "Welcome" section in the course
  content. In the first section in the course, course teams often include
  general information about how the course works and what you can expect, and
  also what they expect from you, in the first section in the course.

* Participate in the :ref:`course discussions<Explore Posts>`. Other learners
  might be able to answer your question, or might have the same question
  themselves. If you encounter an unfamiliar word, phrase, or abbreviation,
  such as "finger exercise" or "board work", search for it on the
  **Discussion** page, or post a question about it yourself. Your comments and
  questions give the course team useful feedback for improving the course.

* Investigate other resources. Some courses have a :ref:`wiki<SFD Wiki>`,
  which can be a good source of information. Outside of the course, a
  course-specific Facebook page or Twitter feed might be available for
  learners to share information.

=================================
Resources on the edx.org Website
=================================

To help you get started with the edX learning experience, edX offers a course
(of course!). You can find the edX Demo_ course on the edx.org website.

When you are working in an edX course, you can select **Help** to access a
help center with `frequently asked questions`_  and answers.

If you still have questions or suggestions, you can contact the `edX Support`_ 
team for help.

edX Global Community meetup_ group.
