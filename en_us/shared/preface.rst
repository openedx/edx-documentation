**************************
Resources for Learners
**************************

Documentation
-------------

The `EdX Learner's Guide`_ and the `Open edX Learner's Guide`_ are  available
on the docs.edx.org web page. Because learners are currently only guided to
this resource through the courseware, we encourage course teams to provide
learners with links to these guides as needed in course updates or discussions.

In a Course
------------

All edX courses have a discussion forum where you can ask questions and
interact with other students and with the course team: click **Discussion**.
Many courses also offer a wiki for additional resources and materials: click
**Wiki**.

Other resources might also be available, such as a course-specific Facebook
page or Twitter feed, or opportunities for Google Hangouts. Be sure to check
the **Course Info** page for your course as well as the **Discussion** and
**Wiki** pages.

From time to time, the course team might send email messages to all students.
While you can opt out of these messages, doing so means that you can miss
important or time-sensitive information. To change your preferences for course
email, click **edX** or **edX edge** at the top of any page. On your dashboard
of current courses, locate the course and then click **Email Settings**.

From edX
---------

To help you get started with the edX learning experience, edX offers a course
(of course!). You can find the edX Demo_ course on the edX web site. EdX also
maintains a list of `frequently asked questions`_  and answers.

If you still have questions or suggestions, you can get help from the edX
support team: click **Contact** at the bottom of any edX web page or send an
email message to info@edx.org.

For opportunities to meet others who are interested in edX courses, check the
edX Global Community meetup_ group.
