Preface
############

Course teams, researchers, developers, students: the edX community includes
groups with a range of reasons for using the platform and objectives to
accomplish. To help members of each group learn about what edX offers, reach
goals, and solve problems, edX provides a variety of information resources.

To help you find what you need, browse the edX offerings in these categories:

* :ref:`Resources for Course Teams`
* :ref:`Resources for Researchers`
* :ref:`Resources for Developers`
* :ref:`Resources for Students`

All members of the edX community are encouraged to make use of any of the
resources described in this preface.

.. _Resources for Students:

**************************
Resources for Students
**************************

Documentation
-------------

The `edX Guide for Students`_ is available on the docs.edx.org web page.
Because students are not currently guided to this resource through the
courseware, we encourage course staff to provide links to students as needed
in course updates or discussions.

In a Course
------------

All edX courses have a discussion forum where you can ask questions and
interact with other students and with the course team: click **Discussion**.
Many courses also offer a wiki for additional resources and materials: click
**Wiki**.

Other resources might also be available, such as a course-specific Facebook
page or Twitter feed, or opportunities for Google Hangouts. Be sure to check
the **Course Info** page for your course as well as the **Discussion** and
**Wiki** pages.

From time to time, the course team might send email messages to all students.
While you can opt out of these messages, doing so means that you can miss
important or time-sensitive information. To change your preferences for course
email, click **edX** or **edX edge** at the top of any page. On your dashboard
of current courses, locate the course and then click **Email Settings**.

From edX
---------

To help you get started with the edX learning experience, edX offers a course
(of course!). You can find the edX Demo_ course on the edX web site. EdX also
maintains a list of frequently_ asked questions and answers.

If you still have questions or suggestions, you can get help from the edX
support team: click **Contact** at the bottom of any edX web page or send an
email message to info@edx.org.

For opportunities to meet others who are interested in edX courses, check the
edX Global Community meetup_ group.
