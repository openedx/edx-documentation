****************************************
Sharing Control
****************************************
The different options in the control will enable you to share all videos in a course, share no videos, or allow control on a per-video basis. The default state for a course is *Per Video*.

.. note:: Setting the control to *All Videos* or *No Videos* will enable or disable sharing for all videos in the course, **regardless of any per-video setting**. Per-video settings **are** preserved and will apply if the course is set to *Per Video* 

Per Video
=========

This is the default state for a course. The default state for a video is unshared. To change the sharing state for a video, click the edit option for the video and navigate to the *Social Sharing* section. This section of the editor will indicate if this video is shared and if the course or the video controls if it is shared or not.

.. note:: Per video share state is persisted even if the course is set to all or no videos. Changing the course to per-video will restore what ever state the video was in beforehand.

All Videos
==========

Setting the course to *All Videos* will enable the social sharing links on all course videos.

No Videos
=========
Setting the course to *No Videos* will disable the social sharing links on all course videos.  Any previously shared video links will no longer work, clicking on one in a social media platform  in this state will return a 404 error.

****************************************
Video Interaction
****************************************
The social media platorm, when able, will redirect interactions (i.e., clicks) back to the edX platform and provide a rich interaction with the video and the course.  On this page one can:

* Play the video, with all edx specific controls, as in a course.
* Learn more about the course.
* Directly enroll or if already enrolled, retun to the course.
