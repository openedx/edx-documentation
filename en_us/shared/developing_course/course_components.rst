For more information about specific component types, see the following topics.

* :ref:`Course Components Index`
* :ref:`Exercises and Tools Index`

.. _What is a Component:

********************
What is a Component?
********************

A component is the part of a unit that contains your actual course content. A
unit can contain one or more components.

By default, Studio includes four basic types of components for you to add to
your course.

* **Discussion** components provide discussion spaces in the body of your
  course. Learners can explore ideas about a lesson with their peers in a
  discussion space.
* **HTML** components allow you to add text, images, and some types of learning
  tools to your course. Content in HTML components is formatted as HTML.
* **Problem** components enable you to add many different types of exercises
  and problems to your course, from simple multiple choice problems to complex
  circuit schematic exercises.
* **Video** components contain the videos that you want to include in your
  course.

.. _Add a Component:

********************
Add a Component
********************

To add a component to the unit, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open the page for the unit.
#. Under **Add New Component**, select a component type. The default component
   types are discussion, HTML, problem, and video.

For more information, see the documentation for the specific component type
that you want to work with.

- :ref:`Working with Discussion Components`
- :ref:`Working with HTML Components`
- :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
- :ref:`Working with Video Components`

After you add a component, it is not visible to learners until you
:ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. _Edit a Component:

********************
Edit a Component
********************

To edit a component, you select **Edit** in the component's title bar in
Studio.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/unit-edit.png
  :alt: A component with the Edit icon indicated in the toolbar.
  :width: 400

Then, follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you edit a component, the changes are not visible to learners until you
:ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

=====================================
Set the Display Name for a Component
=====================================

The display name identifies the component. This name appears as a heading
above the component in the LMS, and it identifies the component for you in
Insights.

The following illustration shows the display name of a problem in Studio, in
the LMS, and in Insights.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/display_names_problem.png
 :alt: The identifying display name for a problem in Studio, the LMS, and
     Insights.
 :width: 800

Unique, descriptive display names help you and your learners identify
components quickly and accurately.

To set the display name for a component, follow these steps.

#. Edit the component. A dialog box opens.

   * For a discussion or video component, the dialog box opens to the list of
     settings, including the **Display Name** field.

   * For an HTML or problem component, the dialog box opens to an editing view.
     Select **Settings** to show the list of settings, including the **Display
     Name** field.

#. Edit the **Display Name** field.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/display-name.png
    :alt: The settings dialog box for a problem component.
    :width: 500

#. Select **Save**.

Different types of components have different fields in the **Settings** dialog
box, but all of them have a **Display Name** field.


.. _Set Access Restrictions For a Component:

***************************************
Set Access Restrictions for a Component
***************************************

If you have more than one enrollment track in your course, or if you have
enabled cohorts, you can limit a component's availability to specific groups of
learners. For information about offering different content to different learner
groups, see :ref:`Offering Differentiated Content`.

.. note:: Components inherit any group access restrictions that are set for
   their parent unit. If you set additional group access restrictions for a
   component, make sure the component access settings do not contradict the
   unit access settings. For example, you cannot give Group A of learners
   access to a component if Group A does not have access to the unit that
   contains the component.

To specify a component's access settings, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Content**, and then select **Outline**.

#. On a unit page, for each component for which you want to restrict access to,
   select the **Access Settings** icon.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_access_settings.png
    :alt: The access settings icon for a component on a Studio unit page
    :width: 500

#. In the **Editing access** dialog box, for the **Restrict access to** option,
   select the group type by which you want to restrict access.

   .. note::  The **Enrollment Track Groups** option is available only if your
       course has more than one :ref:`enrollment track<enrollment_track_g>`.
       The **Content Groups** option is available only if you have created
       :ref:`content groups<About Content Groups>` for use with cohorts.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_access_select_grouptype.png
    :alt: The access settings dialog for a component, with a dropdown list for
       selecting the type of learner group you will use for restricting access.
    :width: 300

   After you have selected a group type, you see a list of the groups that
   exist for that group type.

#. Select the checkbox for each group for which you want the current component
   to be available.

#. Select **Save**.

   The groups which have access to the component are listed under the
   component title in the Studio course outline.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_access_indicator.png
    :alt: When a component has restricted access, a message listing the groups
      which have access to the component appears under the component title in
      the Studio course outline.
    :width: 500

   In addition, on the unit page in Studio, a message in the publishing status
   bar indicates that some content in the unit is restricted to specific groups
   of learners.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/components_restricted_access_indicator.png
    :alt: When any component in a unit has restricted access, a message
      appears in the unit's publishing status bar.
    :width: 250


.. _Duplicate a Component:

**********************
Duplicate a Component
**********************

When you duplicate a component, a new copy of that component is added directly
beneath the first component. You can then modify the duplicate. In many cases,
duplicating a component and editing the copy is a faster way to create new
content.

To duplicate a component, select the **Duplicate** icon in the component
header.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/unit-dup.png
  :alt: A unit with the Duplicate icon selected and highlighted.

Then, follow instructions for the type of component you are editing.

After you duplicate a component, the new component is not visible to learners
until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.

.. note::  Duplicating content experiments after you have configured them is not
   supported.


.. _Delete a Component:

**********************
Delete a Component
**********************

.. caution::
 Be sure you want to delete the component. You cannot undo the deletion.

To delete a component, follow these steps.

#. Select the **Delete** icon in the component header.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/unit-delete.png
  :alt: A unit with the Delete icon circled.

2. When you receive the confirmation prompt, select **Yes, delete this
   component**.

After you delete a component in Studio, the component remains visible to
learners until you :ref:`publish the unit<Publish a Unit>`.


.. _Reorganizing Components:

******************************************
Reorganizing Components
******************************************

You can drag and drop components to a new position within their current unit,
or you can move components from one unit to another unit.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

======================================
Reorganize Components Within a Unit
======================================

To reorganize components within their current unit, you drag and drop
components in the same way that you can drag and drop units, subsections, and
sections on the **Course Outline** page. For more information, see
:ref:`Reorganize the Course Outline`.

For components that consist of nested components (for example, a content
experiment), you can also use drag and drop to move a child component into a
different parent component, if both parents are expanded. For example, you can
select the video component that is in Child Component A and drag it into Child
Component B. Select the video component, and as you drag it into Child
Component B, release the mouse button when a dashed outline of the component
you are moving appears in the new location.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/drag_child_component.png
 :alt: A child component being dragged to a new location in a different parent
       component.
 :width: 400

You can also drag a child component outside of a parent, so that the child
moves to the same level as the parent.

================================
Move Components to Other Units
================================

To move components to another unit in the course outline, follow these steps.

#. Select the **Move** icon for the component that you want to move.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_move_icon.png
      :alt: The action icons for components, with the Move icon highlighted.

   A dialog box appears that displays your course outline tree, starting at the
   section level.

#. In the **Move** dialog box, navigate to the location where you want to move
   the component by selecting the section, the subsection, and then the unit.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_move_navigation.png
      :alt: The Move dialog box displays your course outline tree for
        navigating to the unit that you want to move your component to.
      :width: 380

   The **Move** button is enabled only when your selected location is a valid
   level and location for moving your component. For example, when you move a
   component, the **Move** button is enabled only when you have navigated to
   a unit to which the component can be moved.

#. Select **Move**.

   The component moves to the new location. A success message appears that
   provides options to go to the new location or to undo the move.

   .. note::

       If the old and new locations of the component that you moved were
       previously published, your changes are not reflected in the learner's
       view of the course until you republish the affected units.


.. _Components that Contain Other Components:

******************************************
Components that Contain Other Components
******************************************

For specific use cases, you configure course content so that components contain
other components. For example, if you want to include conditional components or
content experiments, you have to create components inside components. See
:ref:`Creating Content Experiments` for more information.

The component that contains other components is referred to as the *parent*;
the contained components are referred to as child components, or children.

On a unit page, a parent component appears with its display name and a
**View** link.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/component_container.png
 :alt: A unit page with a parent component.
 :width: 500


========================
Edit a Parent Component
========================

A parent component does not directly contain content. Content such as HTML,
videos, or problems are in the child components.

A parent component has a display name. When the unit is private or in draft,
select **Edit** in the parent component to change the display name.

.. note::
  Parent components of a specific type, such as content experiments, have
  additional attributes that you edit.


======================
View Child Components
======================

When you select **View** in the parent component, the parent component page
opens, showing all child components. In this example, Child Component A
contains an HTML component and a video.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/child-components-a.png
 :alt: An expanded child component.
 :width: 400

Select the arrow next to a child component name to collapse it and hide the
component's contents. Select the arrow again to expand the component.

For more information, see the following topics.

* `Edit a Component`_
* `Set the Display Name for a Component`_
* `Duplicate a Component`_
* `Delete a Component`_

======================================
Add a Child Component
======================================

If the containing unit is private or in draft, you can add a child component in
its parent component.

To add a child component, open and expand the parent component. Then, select
the component type that you want under **Add New Component** within the parent
component.

For more information, see the section for the specific component type that you
want.

- :ref:`Working with Discussion Components`
- :ref:`Working with HTML Components`
- :ref:`Working with Problem Components`
- :ref:`Working with Video Components`


======================================
XML for Parent and Child Components
======================================

You develop parent and child components in XML, then import the XML course into
Studio to verify that the structure is as you intended.

For more information about working with your course's XML files, including
information about terminology, see the `EdX Open Learning XML Guide <https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-open-learning-xml/en/latest/>`_.

The following examples show the XML used to create the unit and components
shown in Studio above.

The XML for the unit is as follows.

.. code-block:: xml

    <vertical display_name="Unit 1">
        <html url_name="6a5cf0ea41a54b209e0815147896d1b2"/>
        <vertical url_name="131a499ddaa3474194c1aa2eced34455"/>
    </vertical>

The ``<vertical url_name="131a499ddaa3474194c1aa2eced34455"/>`` element above
references the parent component file that contains the child components.

.. code-block:: xml

    <vertical display_name="Parent Component">
        <vertical url_name="2758bbc495dd40d59050da15b40bd9a5"/>
        <vertical url_name="c5c8b27c2c5546e784432f3b2b6cf2ea"/>
    </vertical>

The two verticals referenced by the parent component refer to the child
components, which contain the actual content of your course.

.. code-block:: xml

    <vertical display_name="Child Component A">
        <html url_name="4471618afafb45bfb86cbe511973e225"/>
        <video url_name="fbd800d0bdbd4cb69ac70c47c9f699e1"/>
    </vertical>

.. code-block:: xml

    <vertical display_name="Child Component B">
        <html url_name="dd6ef295fda74a639842e1a49c66b2c7"/>
        <problem url_name="b40ecbe4ed1b4280ae93e2a158edae6f"/>
    </vertical>

Theoretically, there is no limit to the levels of component nesting you can use
in your course.


======================================
The Learner View of Nested Components
======================================

For learners, all parent and child components appear on the unit page.

.. note::
 The visibility of nested components depends on the visibility of the parent
 unit. The parent unit must be public for learners to see nested components.
 For more information, see :ref:`Unit States and Visibility to Students`.

The following example shows the learner view of the unit described above.
