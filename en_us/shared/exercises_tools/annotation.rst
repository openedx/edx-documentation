Annotation Problem
###################

.. note:: EdX offers provisional support for this problem type.

In an annotation problem, you highlight specific text inside a larger text
block and then ask questions about that text. The questions appear when
students move their cursors over the highlighted text. The questions also
appear in a section below the text block, along with space for students'
responses.
