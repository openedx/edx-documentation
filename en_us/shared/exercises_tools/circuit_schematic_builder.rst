.. note:: EdX offers provisional support for this problem type.

In circuit schematic builder problems, students can arrange circuit elements such as voltage sources, capacitors, resistors, and MOSFETs on an interactive grid. They then submit a DC, AC, or transient analysis of their circuit to the system for grading.

                <p>Explanation</p>
                <p>A voltage divider that evenly divides the input voltage can be formed with two identically valued resistors, with the sampled voltage taken in between the two.</p>

                <p>A simple high-pass filter without any further constaints can be formed by simply putting a resister in series with a capacitor. The actual values of the components do not really matter in order to meet the constraints of the problem.</p>
