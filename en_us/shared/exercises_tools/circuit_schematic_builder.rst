.. note:: EdX does not support this problem type.

In circuit schematic builder problems, students can arrange circuit elements
such as voltage sources, capacitors, resistors, and MOSFETs on an interactive
grid. They then submit a DC, AC, or transient analysis of their circuit to the
system for grading.

 <problem>
  <p>A circuit that combines two or more signals is called a <i>mixer</i>.  In
  this lab, your goal is to build a mixer that combines the signals generated
  by two voltage sources, V1 and V2, where:</p>
   <ul style="margin-left:2em;">
     <li>
       <p>V1 is a 1 kHz square wave that varies between 0V and +1V, and</p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>V2 is a 5 kHz sine wave that varies between -1V and +1V.</p>
     </li>
   </ul>
  <p>Please design a circuit that mixes V1 and V2 to produce Vout such that</p>
  <center>\[V_\mathrm{out} \approx \frac{1}{2}V_1 + \frac{1}{6}V_2.\]</center>
  <p>The resulting output should be similar to that shown in Figure 1.  The
  maximum value of the output is approximately \(667mV\) and the minimum value
  is approximately \(-167mV\).</p>

  <p>Hint: Figure 2 shows a simple resistive mixer for combining two signals.</p>

   <p>Enter your circuit below, using the appropriate configuration of
   resistors. Please do not modify the wiring or parameters of the voltage
   sources -- your goal is to take the signals they generate and combine them,
   not to change what is generated. Run a 5ms transient analysis to verify the
   correct operation of your circuit. We will be checking for the transient
   waveform at the "output" node.</p>

   <p>When you're done or if you wish to save your work, please click CHECK.
   The checker will be verifying the voltage of the output node at several
   different times, so you'll earn a point only <i>after</i> you've performed
   the transient simulation so that the checker will have a waveform to check!</p>
   <solution>
     <div class="detailed-solution"><p>Explanation:</p>
     <p>The goal is to design a mixer circuit with characteristics of
     \(V_{out}=\frac{1}{2}\cdot V_1+\frac{1}{6}\cdot V_2\)
     You might have started to design your mixer with two resistors only as the example suggests.
     But working through the math, soon you'll realize that the equations return no non-zero value for the resistor components.
     Thus you have to change the design. The next simplest design will be to add a resistor \(R_3\) that connects the node Vout to ground.
     See the schematic below:</p>
     <img src="/static/images/circuits/lab2fmt.png"/>
     <p>Since we are going to use only linear elements in this circuit
     (resistors are linear), superposition will hold
     and thus one can look at the effect of each source \(V_1\) and \(V_2\)
     one at the time:</p>
   [mathjax] V_{out1} = V_1 \cdot \frac{\left(R_2 \parallel R_3\right)}
   {\left(R_2 \parallel R_3+R_1\right)}\\ V_{out2} = V_2 \cdot
   \frac{\left(R_1 \parallel R_3\right)}{\left(R_1 \parallel R_3+R_2\right)}
   \\ V_{out} = V_{out 1} + V_{out 2} \\ V_{out} = V_1 \cdot
   \frac{\left(R_2 \parallel R_3\right)}{\left(R_2\parallel R_3+R_1\right)} +
   V_2 \cdot \frac{\left(R_1 \parallel R_3\right)}{\left(R_1 \parallel R_3 +
   R_2\right)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot V_1+\frac{1}{6} \cdot V_2 [/mathjax]
   <p>Therefore:</p>
   [mathjax] \frac{ \left(R_2 \parallel R_3 \right) }
   { \left( R_2 \parallel R_3 + R_1 \right)} =
   \frac{1}{2} \\\frac{\left( R_1 \parallel R_3 \right) }
   { \left(R_1 \parallel R_3 + R_2 \right)} = \frac{1}{6}  [/mathjax]
   <p>So we have to solve for the resistors given these two equations. You
   might notice that we have 2 equations and 3 unknowns, and that there is
   therefore not a unique solution. That is okay, though. We only have to
   worry if there is no solution, not if there are too many solutions. We will
   simply find one of the many possible correct answers by arbitrarily
   choosing a value for one of the variables later.</p>
   <p>The first equation simplifies to \( R_1 = R_2\parallel R_3\) and the
   second simplifies to \(R_2 = 5 \cdot R_1\parallel R_3\)
   Expanding the notation gives: </p>
   [mathjax]\frac{1}{R_1}=\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}
   \tag{*} \\\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_3}=\frac{5}{R_2}  [/mathjax]
   <p>Subtracting these two equations will yield \(R_2 = 2 \cdot R_3\)
   And putting this back to the starred equation , will result in
   \(R_1 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot R_3\)
   So now we have \(R_2\) and \(R_1\) in terms of \(R_3\) with the following
   ratios:</p>
   [mathjax]R_2 = 2 \cdot R_3 \\ R_1 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot R_3 \\[/mathjax]
   <p>Since the design hadn't mentioned anything about the resistances, one can
   use a simple value of \(R_3= 3Ω\) and find the rest accordingly:</p>
   [mathjax]R_1= 2Ω \\
   R_2= 6Ω \\
   R_3= 3Ω \\
   [/mathjax]
   <p>With these resistor values, doing a transient analysis shows a result which meets the required specs of \(V_{out}\).</p>
