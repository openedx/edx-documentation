.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

The math expression input problem type is a core problem type that can be added
to any course. At a minimum, math expression problems include a question or
prompt and a response field for a numeric answer.

For more information about the core problem types, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

***********
Overview
***********

In math expression input problems, learners enter text that represents a
mathematical expression. The text is converted to a symbolic expression that
appears below the response field. Unlike numerical input problems, which only
allow integers and a few select constants, math expression input problems can
include unknown variables and more complicated symbolic expressions.

For more information about how learners enter expressions, see
:ref:`learners:Math Formatting` in the *EdX Learner's Guide* or
:ref:`openlearners:Math Formatting` in the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

.. note::
  You can make a calculator tool available to your learners on every unit
  page. For more information, see :ref:`Calculator`.

For math expression input problems, the grader uses numerical sampling to
determine whether a learner's response matches the math expression that you
provide, to a specified numerical tolerance. You specify the allowed variables
in the expression as well as the range of values for each variable.

When you create a math expression input problem in Studio, you use `MathJax
<http://www.mathjax.org>`_ to format text strings into "beautiful math." For
more information about how to use MathJax in Studio, see :ref:`MathJax in
Studio`.

.. note:: Math expression input problems currently cannot include negative
 numbers raised to fractional powers, such as (-1)^(1/2). Math expression
 input problems can include complex numbers raised to fractional powers, or
 positive non-complex numbers raised to fractional powers.

======================================
Example Math Expression Input Problem
======================================

In the LMS, learners enter a value into a response field to complete a math
expression input problem. The following example shows a completed math
expression input problem that contains two questions.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/MathExpressionInputExample.png
 :alt: A problem shown in the LMS that requests the symbolic expressions for
   displacement and for elongation of a blade. Both questions were answered
   correctly. The solutions are not shown.

***************************************
Adding a Math Expression Input Problem
***************************************

You add math expression input problems in Studio by selecting the **Problem**
component type and then using the advanced editor to specify the prompt and the
acceptable answer or answers.

To create a math expression input problem, follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.

#. Select **Advanced**.

#. From the list of **Advanced** problem types, select **Math Expression
   Input**. Studio adds a template for the problem to the unit.

#. Select **Edit**. The advanced editor opens the template and shows the OLX
   markup that you can use for this problem type.

#. Replace the guidance provided by the template to add your own text. For
   example, replace the question or prompt, answer options, and solution.

#. Update the OLX to use any additional elements and attributes in your
   problem.

#. Select **Settings** to provide an identifying **Display Name** and define
   settings for the problem. For more information, see :ref:`Problem Settings`.

#. Select **Save**.

============
Template
============

.. note:: The following template includes a Python script. When you add a
  script to a problem component, do not add to or change its internal
  indentation. A "jailed code" error message appears when you save
  the problem in Studio if the ``<script>`` element is indented.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <formularesponse type="ci" samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10"  answer="$computed_response">
      <label>Problem text</label>
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.00001"/>
      <formulaequationinput size="20" />

  <script type="loncapa/python">
  computed_response = PYTHON SCRIPT
  </script>

      <solution>
        <div class="detailed-solution">
          <p>Explanation or solution header</p>
          <p>Explanation or solution text</p>
        </div>
      </solution>
    </formularesponse>
  </problem>

This template includes a placeholder value for the ``samples`` attribute of
``samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10"``. You enter values for this attribute
in the following format:
``samples="VARIABLES@LOWER_BOUNDS:UPPER_BOUNDS#NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES"``. Additional detail follows in the description of the ``<formularesponse>``
element.

========
Elements
========

For math expression input problems, the ``<problem>`` element can include this
hierarchy of child elements.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
      <formularesponse>
          <label>
          <description>
          <formulaequationinput>
          <responseparam>
          <script>
          <solution>

In addition, standard HTML tags can be used to format text.

``<formularesponse>``
************************

Required. Indicates that the problem is a math expression input problem.

The ``<formularesponse>`` tag is similar to the ``<numericalresponse>`` tag
used  by :ref:`numerical input<Numerical Input>` problem types, but
``<formularesponse>`` allows unknown variables.

Attributes
==========

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``type``
     - Can be ``"cs"`` for case sensitive, which is the default, or ``"ci"``
       for case insensitive, so that capitalization does not matter in variable
       names.
   * - ``answer``
     - The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical expression.

       If you precede a variable name in the problem with a dollar sign ($),
       you can include a script in the problem that computes the expression
       in terms of that variable.

   * - ``samples``
     - Specifies important information about the problem in the following
       lists.

       * ``variables``: A set of variables that learners can enter.
       * ``lower_bounds``: For every defined variable, a lower bound on the
         numerical tests to use for that variable.
       * ``upper_bounds``: For every defined variable, an upper bound on the
         numerical tests to use for that variable.
       * ``num_samples``: The number of times to test the expression.

       Commas separate items inside each of the four individual lists. The at
       sign (@), colon (:), and hash tag (#) characters separate the lists.
       An example of the format follows.

       ``"variables@lower_bounds:upper_bounds#num_samples"``

       For example, a ``<formularesponse>`` element that includes the
       ``samples`` attribute might look like either of the following.

       ``<formularesponse samples="x,n@1,2:3,4#10">``

       ``<formularesponse samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10">``

* ``<responseparam>``
* ``<script>``
* ``<solution>``

``<label>``
***********

Required. Identifies the question or prompt. You can include HTML tags within
this element.

Attributes

None.

Children
========

None.

``<description>``
*****************

Optional. Provides clarifying information about how to answer the question. You
can include HTML tags within this element.

Attributes

None.

Children
========

None.

``<formulaequationinput>``
**************************

Required. Creates a response field in the LMS where learners enter a response.

Learners also see a second field below the response field that displays a
typeset version of the entered response. The parser that renders a learner's
plain text into typeset math is the same parser that evaluates the response for
grading.

Attributes
==========

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``size``
     - Optional. Defines the width, in characters, of the response field in
       the LMS.

Children
========

None.

``<responseparam>``
*******************

Used to define an upper bound on the variance of the numerical methods used to
approximate a test for equality.

Attributes
==========

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``type``
     - ``"tolerance"`` defines a tolerance for a number.
   * - ``default``
     - Required. A number or a percentage specifying how close the learner
       and grader expressions must be. If you do not include a tolerance, the
       expression is vulnerable to rounding errors during sampling. The
       result of such unavoidable errors is that the grader can mark some
       learner input as incorrect, even if it is algebraically equivalent.

Children
========

None.

``<script>``
*************

Optional. Specifies a script that the grader uses to evaluate a learner's
response. A problem behaves as if all of the code in all of the script elements
were in a single script element. Specifically, any variables that are used in
multiple ``<script>`` elements share a namespace and can be overridden.

As with all Python code, indentation matters, even though the code is embedded
in XML.

Attributes
==========

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``type``
     - Required. Must be set to ``loncapa/python``.

Children
========

None.

``<solution>``
**************

Optional. Identifies the explanation or solution for the problem, or for one of
the questions in a problem that contains more than one question.

This element contains an HTML division ``<div>``. The division contains one or
more paragraphs ``<p>`` of explanatory text.
