Math Expression Input Problems

.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

In math expression input problems, learners enter text that represents a
mathematical expression. The text is converted to a symbolic expression that
appears below the response field. Unlike numerical input problems, which only
allow integers and a few select constants, math expression input problems can
include unknown variables and more complicated symbolic expressions.

     of N(x) for a sleeved cylinder

For more information about how learners enter expressions, see `Math Response
Formatting for Students`_.

.. note::
  You can make a calculator available to your learners on every unit
  page. For more information, see :ref:`Calculator`.

For the math expression input problems in your course, you can use edX
Insights to review aggregated learner performance data and examine
submitted answers. For more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

For math expression input problems, the grader uses numerical sampling to
determine whether a learner's response matches the math expression that you
provide, to a specified numerical tolerance. You specify the allowed variables
in the expression as well as the range of values for each variable.

When you create a math expression input problem in Studio, you use `MathJax
<http://www.mathjax.org>`_ to change your plain text into "beautiful math."
For more information about how to use MathJax in Studio, see :ref:`MathJax in
Studio`.

.. note:: Math expression input problems currently cannot include negative
 numbers raised to fractional powers, such as (-1)^(1/2). Math expression
 input problems can include complex numbers raised to fractional powers, or
 positive non-complex numbers raised to fractional powers.

************************************************
Create a Math Expression Input Problem

To create a math expression input problem, follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.
#. Select **Advanced**.
#. Select **Math Expression Input**. Studio adds an example math expression
   input problem to the unit.
#. Select **Edit**. The Advanced Editor opens.
#. Replace the sample problem XML with your own marked up text. To
   practice, you can use the example problem that follows.
#. Select **Settings** and provide an identifying **Display Name** for the
   problem.
#. Define additional settings for the problem. For more information, see
   :ref:`Problem Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

====
Tags
====

* ``<formularesponse>``
* ``<formulaequationinput />``
* ``<responseparam>``
* ``<script>``

**Tag:** ``<formularesponse>``

Specifies that the problem is a math expression input problem. The
``<formularesponse>`` tag is similar to ``<numericalresponse>``, but
``<formularesponse>`` allows unknown variables.

  Attributes

  ``type``: Can be "cs" for case sensitive, which is the default, or "ci" for case
  insensitive, so that capitalization does not matter in variable names.

  ``answer``: The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical
  expression. If you precede a variable name in the problem with a dollar sign
  ($), you can include a script in the problem that computes the expression in
  terms of that variable.

  ``samples``: Specifies important information about the problem in the
  following lists.

    * ``variables``: A set of variables that learners can enter.
    * ``lower_bounds``: For every defined variable, a lower bound on the
      numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * ``upper_bounds``: For every defined variable, an upper bound on the
      numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * ``num_samples``: The number of times to test the expression.

    Commas separate items inside each of the four individual lists. The at
    sign (@), colon (:), and pound sign (#) characters separate the lists. An
    example of the format follows.

    ``"variables@lower_bounds:upper_bounds#num_samples"``

    For example, a ``<formularesponse>`` tag that includes the ``samples``
    attribute might look like either of the following.

    ``<formularesponse samples="x,n@1,2:3,4#10">``

    ``<formularesponse samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10">``

  Children

  ``<formulaequationinput />``

**Tag:** ``<formulaequationinput />``

Creates a response field where a learner enters an answer to the problem in
plain text, as well as a second field below the response field where the
learner sees a typeset version of the plain text. The parser that renders the
learner's plain text into typeset math is the same parser that evaluates the
learner's response for grading.

     :widths: 20 80

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - label (required)
       - Specifies the name of the response field.
     * - size (optional)
       - Specifies the width, in characters, of the response field where
         learners enter answers.

  Children

**Tag:** ``<responseparam>``

Used to define an upper bound on the variance of the numerical methods used to
approximate a test for equality.

  Attributes

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - default (required)
       - A number or a percentage specifying how close the learner and grader
         expressions must be. If you do not include a tolerance, the
         expression is vulnerable to rounding errors during sampling. The
         result of such unavoidable errors is that the grader can mark some
         learner input as incorrect, even if it is algebraically equivalent.
     * - type
       - "tolerance", which defines a tolerance for a number.

  Children
