Math Expression Input Problems
####################################

In math expression input problems, students enter text that represents a mathematical expression into a field, and text is converted to a symbolic expression that appears below that field. Unlike numerical input problems, which only allow integers and a few select constants, math expression problems can include unknown variables and more complicated symbolic expressions.

For more information about characters that students can enter, see :ref:`Math Response Formatting for Students`.

The grader uses a numerical sampling to determine whether the student's response matches the instructor-provided math expression, to a specified numerical tolerance. The instructor must specify the allowed variables in the expression as well as the range of values for each variable.

.. warning:: Math expression input problems cannot currently include negative numbers raised to fractional powers, such as (-1)^(1/2). Math expression input problems can include complex numbers raised to fractional powers, or positive non-complex numbers raised to fractional powers.

When you create a math expression input problem in Studio, you'll use `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org>`_ to change your plain text into "beautiful math." For more information about how to use MathJax in Studio, see :ref:`MathJax in Studio`.

    <p>Some problems may ask for a mathematical expression. Practice creating mathematical expressions by answering the questions below.</p>

    <p>Write an expression for the product of R_1, R_2, and the inverse of R_3.</p>

Tags
====

* ``<formularesponse>``
* ``<formulaequationinput />``
* ``<responseparam>``
* ``<script>``

**Tag:** ``<formularesponse>``

Specifies that the problem is a math expression input problem. The ``<formularesponse>`` tag is similar to ``<numericalresponse>``, but ``<formularesponse>`` allows unknown variables.

  Attributes

  **type**: Can be "cs" (case sensitive, the default) or "ci" (case insensitive, so that capitalization doesn't matter in variable names).

  **answer**: The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical expression. If you precede a variable name in the problem with a dollar sign ($), you can include a script in the problem that computes the expression in terms of that variable.

  **samples**: Specifies important information about the problem in four lists:

    * **variables**: A set of variables that students can enter.
    * **lower_bounds**: For every defined variable, a lower bound on the numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * **upper_bounds**: For every defined variable, an upper bound on the numerical tests to use for that variable.
    * **num_samples**: The number of times to test the expression.

    Commas separate items inside each of the four individual lists, and the at sign (@), colon (:), and pound sign (#) characters separate the four lists. The format is the following:

    ``"variables@lower_bounds:upper_bounds#num_samples``

    For example, a ``<formularesponse>`` tag that includes the **samples** attribute may look like either of the following.

    ``<formularesponse samples="x,n@1,2:3,4#10">``

    ``<formularesponse samples="R_1,R_2,R_3@1,2,3:3,4,5#10">``

  Children

  * ``<formulaequationinput />``

**Tag:** ``<formulaequationinput />``

Creates a response field where a student types an answer to the problem in plain text, as well as a second field below the response field where the student sees a typeset version of the plain text. The parser that renders the student's plain text into typeset math is the same parser that evaluates the student's response for grading.

       - Description
     * - label (required)
       - Specifies the name of the response field.
     * - size (optional)
       - Specifies the width, in characters, of the response field where students enter answers.

**Tag:** ``<responseparam>``

Used to define an upper bound on the variance of the numerical methods used to approximate a test for equality.

  Attributes

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - default (required)
       - A number or a percentage specifying how close the student and grader expressions must be. Failure to include a tolerance leaves expressions vulnerable to unavoidable rounding errors during sapling, causing some student input to be graded as incorrect, even if it is algebraically equivalent to the grader's expression.
     * - type
       - "tolerance"--defines a tolerance for a number
