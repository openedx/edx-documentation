Single Select Problem
########################

.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

The single select problem type is a simple problem type that can be added to
any course. At a minimum, single select problems include a question or
prompt and several answer options. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can
give learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

For more information about the simple problem types, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

**********
Overview
**********

In single select problems, learners select one option from a list of answer
options. Unlike :ref:`dropdown<Dropdown>` problems, where the answer choices
do not appear until the learner selects the dropdown arrow, answer choices for
single select problems are immediately visible directly below the question.

Single select problems can also have several advanced options, such as
reordering, or shuffling, the set of answer choices for each learner. For more
information about these options, see
:ref:`Editing Single Select Problems using the Advanced Editor`.

================================
Example Single Select Problem
================================

In the LMS, learners select a single answer option to complete a single
select problem. An example of a completed single select problem follows.

   the answer options was incorrectly selected. An explanation appears below
   the answer options.

===========================================================
Pedagogical Considerations for Single Select Questions
===========================================================

EdX recommends the use, whenever possible, of authentic assessment rather than
single select questions for graded problems. The use of authentic assessment
in online courses tends to lead to better learning outcomes. In addition,
authentic assessment allows for infinite attempts, mastery learning, and more
intellectual risk taking, which lead to substantially better learning outcomes.

Single select questions do have these uses.

* Ungraded single select questions can help students think about a concept in
  the context of knowledge transfer.

* For many subject areas, authentic assessments are either unavailable or
  prohibitively complex to use. In such courses, single select questions can
  act as the only available fall back.

Fortunately, single select questions are among the best studied in assessment
literature. A few guidelines for the creation of such questions follow.

* Organize the set of answers logically. Use consistent phrasing for the
  answers, and when possible, parallel structure.

* Place as many of the words in the stem as possible, and keep the answers as
  concise as possible.

* The distractors should not be substantially shorter, longer, or use different
  structure than the correct answer. The answer options should be as consistent
  in structure, length, and phrasing as possible.

* Avoid using negatives (and especially double negatives) in the question and
  the answers.

* Test higher order thinking (comprehension and critical thinking). Avoid
  simple recall.

* If you specify a finite number of attempts, avoid trick questions and try to
  keep wording clear and unambiguous.

* Make all distractors plausible.

* Use "All of the above" and "None of the above" answer options with caution.
  If a learner can identify at least two correct answers, it can give away the
  answer with only partial comprehension.

Creating a single select problem is as simple as:

#. Editing the **Display Name**. Click the pen symbol to edit.
#. Filling in the **Question** field.
#. Filling in the **Explanation** field. When this is shown to learners is
   based on the selection in the **Show answer** panel on the right.
#. Filling in the **Answer** fields. Select the correct answer(s) by ticking
   off the checkbox(es). Additional answers can be added by clicking the 
   **Add answer** button. Answers can be deleted by clicking the trash can icon.
   Feedback can be provided for each answer. More information on feedback can be
   found in the following section.
#. Selecting and filling in any desired settings on the right.

If you have any questions on the specifics of using the simple editor, please check
out :ref:`Simple Editor` and :ref:`Problem Settings`.

Note


.. note:: With the single select problem type, although the learner only selects
  one answer, you can set more than one correct answer. You can do this by ticking
  more than one of the checkboxes in the Answers section.

.. _Use Feedback in a Single Select Problem:

================================
Adding Feedback
================================

For an overview of feedback in problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to
a Problem`. You can add feedback for each of the answer options you provide in
the problem. Use the following guidelines when providing feedback.

* Add feedback to incorrect answers to target common misconceptions and
  mistakes.

* Ensure feedback provides some guidance to the learner about how to arrive at
  the correct answer.

* Add feedback for the correct answer to reinforce why the answer is correct.
  Because learners are able to guess, ensure that feedback provides a reason
  why the answer is correct for learners who might have selected that answer by
  chance.

You can add answer-specific feedback for each answer in a single select problem.
You can access the feedback panel shown below by clicking the button to the
right of the answer text.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_feedback_box.png
 :alt: An image of the feedback section. There are options for when the
    student's answer is selected.
 :width: 600

Simply enter your feedback message in this text field. It will display when the
learner submits this answer.

.. _Use Hints in a Single Select Problem:

================================
Adding Hints
================================

You can add hints to a single select problem . For an overview of hints in
problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. _Editing Single Select Problems using the Advanced Editor:

*************************************************************
Editing Single Select Problems using the Advanced Editor
*************************************************************

If the simple editor is not enough to meet your needs, you can switch over to the
advanced editor. In the setting panels on the right of the editor, click 
**Show advanced settings**, then scroll down and click 
**Switch to advanced editor**.

You can use the advanced editor to identify the elements of a single select problem
with OLX. For more information, see :ref:`Single Select Problem XML`. To format equations,
you can use MathJax. For more information, see :ref:`MathJax in Studio`.

You can see the OLX for the example problem from the Overview section below.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>Lateral inhibition, as was first discovered in the horseshoe crab:</label>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
        <choice correct="false">is a property of touch sensation, referring to
        the ability of crabs to detect nearby predators.</choice>
        <choice correct="false">is a property of hearing, referring to the
        ability of crabs to detect low frequency noises.</choice>
        <choice correct="false">is a property of vision, referring to the
        ability of crabs' eyes to enhance contrasts.</choice>
        <choice correct="true">has to do with the ability of crabs to use
        sonar to detect fellow horseshoe crabs nearby.</choice>
        <choice correct="false">has to do with a weighting system in the
        crab's skeleton that allows it to balance in turbulent water.</choice>
      </choicegroup>
      <solution>
        <div class="detailed-solution">
          <p>Explanation</p>
          <p>Horseshoe crabs were essential to the discovery of lateral
          inhibition, a property of vision present in horseshoe crabs as well
          as humans that enables enhancement of contrast at edges of objects
          as was demonstrated in class. In 1967, Haldan Hartline received the
          Nobel prize for his research on vision and in particular his
          research investigating lateral inhibition using horseshoe crabs.</p>
        </div>
      </solution>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

.. note:: You can begin work on the problem in the simple editor, and then
  switch to the advanced editor. However, after you save any advanced OLX
  changes you make in the advanced editor, you may not be able to cannot
  switch back to the simple editor.

====================
Adding Feedback
====================

In the advanced editor, you configure feedback with the following syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choice correct="false">Choice Label
    <choicehint>Feedback for when learner selects this answer.</choicehint>
  </choice>

For example, the following problem has feedback for each answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>Which of the following is an example of a vegetable?</label>
      <description>You can select only one option.</description>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
        <choice correct="false">apple
          <choicehint>An apple is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple
          tree and contains seeds classifying it as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false">pumpkin
          <choicehint>A pumpkin is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant
          and contains seeds classifying it as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true">potato
          <choicehint>A potato is an edible part of a plant in tuber form and
          is classified as a vegetable.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false">tomato
          <choicehint>Many people mistakenly think a tomato is a vegetable.
          However, because a tomato is the fertilized ovary of a tomato plant
          and contains seeds it is classified as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
      </choicegroup>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

.. _Targeted Feedback in a Single Select Problem:

-------------------------
Targeted Feedback
-------------------------

You can configure a single select problem so that explanations for specific
answers are automatically shown to learners. You can use these explanations to
guide learners towards the right answer. Therefore, targeted feedback is most
useful for single select problems for which learners are allowed multiple attempts.

You configure the problem to provide targeted feedback by editing the OLX in
the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>`.

* Add a ``targeted-feedback`` attribute to the ``<multiplechoiceresponse>``
  element, with no value: ``<multiplechoiceresponse targeted-feedback="">``.

* Add an ``explanation-id`` attribute with a unique value to each of the
  ``<choice>`` elements: ``<choice correct="false"
  explanation-id="feedback1">``.

* You can use the ``<solution>`` element for the correct answer.

* Add a ``<targetedfeedbackset>`` element after the
  ``<multiplechoiceresponse>`` element.

* Within ``<targetedfeedbackset>``, add one or more ``<targetedfeedback>``
  elements.

* Within each ``<targetedfeedback>`` element, add one of the unique identifying
  ``explanation-id`` attributes to map that feedback to a specific answer
  choice.

* Within each ``<targetedfeedback>`` element use HTML formatting, such as
  ``<p></p>`` tags, to enter your explanation for the specified answer option.

For example, the OLX for a single select problem follows, showing a unique ID
for each answer choice. This is immediately followed by OLX that defines the
targeted feedback.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse targeted-feedback="">
      <label>What Apple device competed with the portable CD player?</label>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
        <choice correct="false" explanation-id="feedback1">The iPad</choice>
        <choice correct="false" explanation-id="feedback2">Napster</choice>
        <choice correct="true" explanation-id="correct">The iPod</choice>
        <choice correct="false" explanation-id="feedback3">The vegetable peeler</choice>
      </choicegroup>
      <solution explanation-id="correct">
        <div class="detailed-solution">
          <p>The iPod directly competed with portable CD players.</p>
        </div>
      </solution>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
    <targetedfeedbackset>
      <targetedfeedback explanation-id="feedback1">
        <div class="detailed-targeted-feedback">
          <p>Targeted Feedback</p>
          <p>The iPad came out later and did not directly compete with
           portable CD players.</p>
         </div>
      </targetedfeedback>
      <targetedfeedback explanation-id="feedback2">
        <div class="detailed-targeted-feedback">
          <p>Targeted Feedback</p>
          <p>Napster was not an Apple product.</p>
        </div>
      </targetedfeedback>
      <targetedfeedback explanation-id="feedback3">
        <div class="detailed-targeted-feedback">

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Multiple Choice Problem:

========================================
Awarding Partial Credit
========================================

You can configure a single select problem so that specific incorrect answers
award learners partial credit for the problem.

.. only:: Partners

 .. note::
    Support for partial credit problems in courses on edx.org and edX
    Edge is provisional. Ensure that you test such problems thoroughly before
    releasing them to learners. For more information, contact your edX partner
    manager.

In the following example, the learner selected a wrong answer and received
partial credit.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/partial_credit_multiple_choice.png
 :alt: A single select problem with partial credit for an incorrect answer.
 :width: 400

You can specify what percentage of the points for the problem a learner
receives for an incorrect answer. If you do not specify the percentage, the
system uses the default of 50%.

For an overview of partial credit in problems, see
:ref:`Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem`.

To configure a single select problem to award partial credit for a specific
answer, you add the following attributes to the problem OLX.

* Add the ``partial_credit="points"`` attribute to the
  ``<multiplechoiceresponse>`` element.

* For each answer that you intend to award partial credit, in the ``<choice>``
  element set the value of the ``correct`` attribute to ``"partial"``.

* Optionally, define the percentage of the problem score to award for each
  answer. Add the ``point_value`` attribute to the ``<choice>`` element, and
  enter its value as a decimal. For example, add ``point_value="0.25"`` to
  award 25% of the points to learners who select that answer. The percentage
  awarded should reflect how close the learner has gotten to a full
  understanding of the concept. If you do not add the ``point_value``
  attribute, the system uses the default of 50%.

For example, the following OLX shows a single select problem that
provides partial credit of 25% for an answer option.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse partial_credit="points">
      <label>Which of the following is a vegetable?</label>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
        .
        .
        .
        <choice correct="partial" point_value="0.25">tomato </choice>
      </choicegroup>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

.. _Shuffle Answers in a Single Select Problem:

=============================================
Shuffle Answers
=============================================

Optionally, you can configure a single select problem so that it shuffles
the order of possible answers.

For example, one view of a problem could be as follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_shuffle_answer_1.png
 :alt: One view of a shuffled single select problem.
 :width: 600

Another view of the same problem, for a different learner or for the same
learner on a subsequent view of the unit, could be as follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_shuffle_answer_2.png
 :alt: Another view of a shuffled single select problem.
 :width: 600

You can also shuffle some answers, but not others. For example, you might
want to include the answer "All of the above" and have it always appear at the
end of the list, but shuffle the other answers.

You can configure the problem to shuffle answers using the advanced editor.
To add shuffling to a single select problem, you add ``shuffle="true"`` to the
``<choicegroup>`` element.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>What Apple device competed with the portable CD player?</label>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice" shuffle="true">
        <choice correct="false">The iPad</choice>
        <choice correct="false">Napster</choice>
        <choice correct="true">The iPod</choice>
        <choice correct="false">The vegetable peeler</choice>
      </choicegroup>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

To make the location of an answer fixed in a shuffled list, add
``fixed="true"`` to the ``choice`` element for the answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>What Apple device competed with the portable CD player?</label>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice" shuffle="true">
        .
        .
        .
        <choice correct="false" fixed="true">All of the above</choice>
      </choicegroup>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

Then, you select **Settings** to specify an option other than **Never** for the
**Randomization** setting.

.. _Answer Pools in a Single Select Problem:

=============================================
Answer Pools
=============================================

You can configure a single select problem so that a random subset of choices
are shown to each learner. For example, you can add 10 possible choices to the
problem, and each learner views a set of five choices.

The answer pool must have at least one correct answer. It can have more than
one correct answer. In each set of choices shown to a learner, one correct
answer is included. For example, you can configure two correct answers in the
set of choices. One of the two correct answers is included in each set that a
learner views.

You configure the problem to provide answer pools by editing the OLX for the
problem in the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>`.

* In the ``<choicegroup>`` element, add the ``answer-pool`` attribute, with the
  numerical value indicating the number of answer options to show to learners.
  For example, ``<choicegroup answer-pool="4">``.

* If you include more than one correct answer among the options, for each
  correct answer add an ``explanation-id`` attribute with a unique value to the
  ``<choice>`` element: ``<choice correct="false" explanation-id="correct1">``.

* If you include more than one correct answer among the options, for each
  ``<solution>`` element, add an ``explanation-id`` attribute and a value that
  maps back to a specific correct answer. For example, ``<solution
  explanation-id="correct1">``.

* Place the ``<solution>`` elements within a ``<solutionset>`` element.

.. note:: If the choices include only one correct answer, you do not have to
 use the ``explanation-id`` in either the ``<choice>`` or ``<solution>``
 element. You do still use the ``<solutionset>`` element to wrap the
 ``<solution>`` element.

For example, for the following single select problem, a learner will see
four choices. In each set, one of the choices will be one of the two correct
choices. The explanation shown for the correct answer is the one with the same
explanation ID.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>What Apple devices let you carry your digital music library in your pocket?</label>
      <description>You can select only one option.</description>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice" answer-pool="4">
        <choice correct="false">The iPad</choice>
        <choice correct="false">Napster</choice>
        <choice correct="true" explanation-id="iPod">The iPod</choice>
        <choice correct="false">The vegetable peeler</choice>
        <choice correct="false">The iMac</choice>
        <choice correct="true" explanation-id="iPhone">The iPhone</choice>
      </choicegroup>
      <solutionset>
        <solution explanation-id="iPod">
          <div class="detailed-solution">
            <p>Explanation</p>
            <p>The iPod is Apple's portable digital music player.</p>
          </div>
        </solution>
        <solution explanation-id="iPhone">
          <div class="detailed-solution">
            <p>Explanation</p>
            <p>In addition to being a cell phone, the iPhone can store and play
             your digital music.</p>
          </div>

.. _Using the Script Element in Single Select Problems:

========================
Using the Script Element
========================

You can use the ``<script>`` element to programmatically set attributes and
options for your single select problems.  You could use this feature to
display different questions/answers depending on variable factors, like time of
day, or randomly generated numbers.

You must use the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>` to configure a
``<script>`` element.

The contents of the ``<script>`` element must be enclosed in ``<![CDATA[`` ...
``]]>`` markers, to indicate that the enclosed code should not be interpreted
as XML.

The code in the ``<script>`` element is run on the server before the problem is
shown to learners.  Note that only Python script types are supported.

The following OLX example uses random numbers to generate different answer
choices for each learner, and mathematical operators to determine each choice's
correctness.

.. code-block:: xml

    <problem>
        <script type="text/python">
        <![CDATA[
        random.seed(anonymous_student_id)  # Use different random numbers for each student.
        a = random.randint(1,10)
        b = random.randint(1,10)
        c = a + b

        ok0 = c % 2 == 0 # check remainder modulo 2
        text0 = "$a + $b is even"

        ok1 = c % 2 == 1 #check remainder modulo 2
        text1 = "$a + $b is odd"
        ]]>
        </script>
        <multiplechoiceresponse>
          <label>Is $a+$b even or odd? Select the true statement.</label>
          <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
            <choice correct="$ok0">$text0 ... (should be $ok0)</choice>
            <choice correct="$ok1">$text1 ... (should be $ok1)</choice>
          </choicegroup>
        </multiplechoiceresponse>
    </problem>

.. note:: After saving a block with scripts, you'll see an error on the block in your
  unit if your script cannot be executed. One common error is the indentation error.
  The script must start on no indentation regardless of the indentation of the previous
  line.
