To use the :ref:`simple editor<Simple Editor>` to add a problem, follow these
steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.

#. From the list of **Common Problem Types**, select the type of problem you
   want to add. Studio adds a template for the problem to the unit.

   Markdown formatting that you use for this problem type.

#. Replace the guidance provided by the template to add your own text for the
   question or prompt, answer options, explanation, and so on.

   To format equations, you can use MathJax. For more information, see
   :ref:`MathJax in Studio`.
