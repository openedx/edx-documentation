Dropdown Problem
#####################

Dropdown problems allow the student to choose from a collection of answer options, presented as a dropdown list. Unlike multiple choice problems, whose answers are always visible directly below the question, dropdown problems don't show answer choices until the student clicks the dropdown arrow.

********************************
Create a Dropdown Problem
********************************

You can create dropdown problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced Editor.

.. note:: All problems must include labels for accessibility. The label generally includes the text of the main question in your problem. To add a label for a common problem, surround the text of the label with angle brackets pointed toward the text (>>label text<<).

================
Simple Editor
================

To create a dropdown problem, follow these steps.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click **Problem**.
#. In the **Select Problem Component Type** screen, click
   **Dropdown** on the **Common Problem Types** tab.
#. In the new Problem component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. Replace the default text with the text for your problem. Enter each of the possible 
   answers on the same line, separated by commas.
#. Determine the text of the problem to use as a label, and then surround that text with two sets of angle brackets (>><<).
#. Select all the answer options, and then click the dropdown button.

   When you do this, a double set of brackets ([[ ]]) appears and surrounds the 
   answer options.
      
#. Inside the brackets, surround the correct answer with parentheses.
#. In the component editor, select the text of the explanation, and then click the 
   explanation button to add explanation tags around the text.

#. Click **Save**.

For the example problem above, the text in the Problem component is the
following.

::

    >>What type of data are the following?<<

    Age:
    [[Nominal, Discrete, (Continuous)]]
    Age, rounded to the nearest year:
    [[Nominal, (Discrete), Continuous]]
    Life stage - infant, child, and adult:
    [[(Nominal), Discrete, Continuous]]
