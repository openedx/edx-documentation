Levels of Support for Tools
************************************

The level of support that edX provides for each tool varies. The description
of each exercise and tool in the following sections indicates the level of
support designated for each tool: full, provisional, or no support. This table
provides the definition for each level of support.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Level of Support
     - Description
   * - Full support
     - Fully supported tools and features are available on edx.org, are fully
       tested, have user interfaces where applicable, and are documented in the
       official edX guides that are available on docs.edx.org.
   * - Provisional support
     - Provisionally supported tools and features are available on edx.org,
       but might lack the robustness of functionality that your courses
       require. You should test provisionally supported tools thoroughly
       before using them in your course, especially in graded sections.
       Complete documentation might not be available for provisionally
       supported tools, or documentation might be available from sources other
       than the official edX guides.
   * - Not supported
     - Exercises and tools with no support are not maintained by edX, and
       might be deprecated in the future. They are not recommended for use in
       courses due to non-compliance with one or more of the base
       requirements, such as testing, accessibility, internationalization, and
       documentation.

Introduction to Exercises and Tools
************************************

"Exercises and tools" is a general way to refer to the robust variety of
content that you can integrate into an online course. You create the graded and
ungraded assessments in your course with different exercises or problem types,
while various tools deliver different types of course content. Software
developers use the XBlock component architecture to contribute new exercises
and tools to the Open edX platform and provide new and varied options for
reaching learners.

* You might need to explicitly enable an exercise or tool that you want to use
  in your course. For more information, see :ref:`Enable Additional Exercises
  and Tools`.

* After you enable an exercise or tool for use with your course, when you add a
  component to a unit, that exercise or tool might be listed as one of the
  **Advanced**, **HTML**, or **Problem** options.

The topics in this section describe different exercises and tools. Information
about how to enable specific exercises and tools is provided, followed by
examples and step-by-step instructions for how you use Studio to add components
to your course. For many of the exercises and tools, when you add a component
Studio presents a template for you to use as a starting point for your work.
XML examples and descriptions of the attributes, tags, and elements that you
can use in an XML editor are also provided.

   * - Type
     - Description
     - Support
   * - :ref:`Annotation`
     - Annotation problems ask learners to respond to questions about a
       specific block of text. The question appears above the text when the
       learner moves the cursor to the highlighted text so that learners can
       think about the question as they read.
     - Provisional support
   * - :ref:`Calculator`
     - The calculator tool is available for every course through the course
       advanced settings. When the calculator tool is enabled, it appears on

       letters, trigonometric functions, and scientific or ``e`` notation in
       addition to common operators.
     - Provisional support
   * - :ref:`completion`
     - This tool allows learners to mark sections of course content as
       completed. It helps learners to track their progress through sections of
       the course (including for ungraded activities such as reading text,
       watching video, or participating in course discussions), and gives them
       a way to indicate to both themselves and course staff that they
       completed the required activities.
