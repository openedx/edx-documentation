You can add a wide variety of different types of problems, exercises, and
tools to your course outline. By default, a core set of :ref:`problem
types<Working with Problem Components>` is available in Studio for you to
include in your course. You have the option to expand the initial set of core
problem types by enabling additional exercises and tools.

******************
Levels of Support
******************

.. only:: Open_edX

 .. note:: The support level definitions described in this section and the
    level of support designated for each exercise, problem type, or tool are
    applicable only to edx.org.

The level of support that edX provides for each problem, exercise, or tool
varies. The levels of support are categorized as full, provisional, or no
support. This table provides the definition for each level of support.

In Studio, the support level for each exercise, problem type, or tool is
represented with an icon when you select **Advanced**, **Text**, or
**Problem** to add a new component to your course. By default, only fully
supported or provisionally supported exercises, problem types, or tools are
available for adding to your course. To add unsupported problem types and
tools, see :ref:`Add_Unsupported_Exercises_Problems`.

.. Internal note: For the OLX Guide there is a separate levels_of_support.rst file under olx/source/problem-xml that contains the levels of support info


.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Level of Support
     - Description
   * - Full support
     - Fully supported tools and features are available on edx.org, are fully
       tested, have user interfaces where applicable, and are documented in the
       official edX guides that are available on docs.edx.org.
   * - Provisional support
     - Provisionally supported tools and features are available on edx.org,
       but might lack the robustness of functionality that your courses
       require. Third party tools are classified as provisionally supported
       because edX does not have control over the quality of the software, or
       of the content that can be provided using such tools.

       You should test provisionally supported tools thoroughly
       before using them in your course, especially in graded sections.
       Complete documentation might not be available for provisionally
       supported tools, or documentation might be available from sources other
       than the official edX guides.
   * - Not supported
     - Exercises and tools with no support are not maintained by edX, and
       might be deprecated in the future. They are not recommended for use in
       courses due to non-compliance with one or more of the base
       requirements, such as testing, accessibility, internationalization, and
       documentation.


**************************************************************
Enhancing Your Course with Additional Exercises and Tools
**************************************************************

"Exercises and tools" is a general way to refer to the robust variety of
content that you can integrate into an online course. Software developers use
the XBlock component architecture to contribute new exercises and tools to the
Open edX platform and provide new and varied options for reaching learners.
Exercises enhance the core set of problem types by challenging learners to
complete graded and ungraded assessments. Tools deliver a variety of other
types of course content.

* To use an exercise or tool in your course beyond the core set of problem
  types, you must explicitly enable that exercise or tool. For more
  information, see :ref:`Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.

* After you enable an exercise or tool for use in your course, you might need
  to select **Advanced**, **Text**, or **Problem** on the unit page to
  add content of that type to your course.

The topics in this section introduce the core set of problem types and a
selection of other exercises and tools that you can add to your course.

*******************
Core Problem Types
*******************

The problem types that you can include in any course, without taking any
other steps to identify or enable additional exercises or tools, are the core
problem types. When you add a problem component in Studio, the core problem
types are classified as either **Simple Problem Types** or **Advanced**.

.. contents::

=====================
Simple Problem Types
=====================

When you create a problem in Studio, the editor opens with options for the
following problem types. When you select any of the simple problem types, the
:ref:`simple editor<Simple Editor>` opens.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 60 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Problem Type
     - Description
     - Support
   * - :ref:`Single Select`
     - In single select problems, learners select one answer from a set of
       possible answers, which are visible directly below the question.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Multi-select`
     - In multi-select problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
       possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select
       all of the options that are correct answers, and none of the options
       that are incorrect.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Dropdown`
     - In dropdown problems, learners choose one answer from a set of possible
       answers, which are presented in a dropdown list after the learner
       selects the dropdown arrow.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Numerical Input`
     - In numerical input problems, learners enter numbers or specific and
       relatively simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. These
       problems allow only integers and a few select constants. You can specify
       a margin of error, and you can specify a correct answer either
       explicitly or by using a Python script.
     - Full support; mobile-ready
   * - :ref:`Text Input`
     - In text input problems, learners enter text into a response field. The
       response can include numbers, letters, and special characters such as
       punctuation marks.
     - Full support; mobile-ready

By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give learners guidance and help
when they work on a problem. When you choose one of the simple problem types,
the editor interface provides additional guidance and text fields for entering
these options. All of these problem types also have full support and are
mobile-ready.

=========
Advanced
=========

If none of the simple problem types fit what you need, the editor's problem type
select page has an option for **Advanced problem types**. Selecting this option
will bring you to a list of advanced problems. When you select any of the
advanced problem types, the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>` opens.

* If you choose the **Blank Advanced Problem** option, the editor opens without
  providing a template or example for you to follow. You can begin to add OLX
  markup and the text for required and optional problem elements immediately.

* If you choose one of the following problem types, a template appears in the
  editor with guidance for adding all of that problem type's required elements,
  as well as several optional elements.

.. note:: Some advanced problem types are :ref:`unsupported<Levels of
   Support>` and are not available in the list of problem types unless you
   enable a setting in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Unsupported
   Advanced Problem Types` and :ref:`Add_Unsupported_Exercises_Problems`.

   * - :ref:`Custom JavaScript Display and Grading<Custom JavaScript>`
     - Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called custom
       JavaScript problems or JS input problems) allow you to create a custom
       problem or tool that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or tool
       directly into Studio.
     - Full support
   * - :ref:`Custom Python-evaluated Input (Write Your Own Grader)<Write Your Own Grader>`
     - In custom Python-evaluated input (also called "write-your-own-grader")
       problems, the grader uses a Python script that you create and embed in
       the problem to evaluate a learner's response or provide hints. These
       problems can be any type.
     - Provisional support
   * - :ref:`Math Expression Input`
     - Learners enter mathematical expressions to answer a question. These
       problems can include unknown variables and more complex symbolic
       expressions. You can specify a correct answer either explicitly or by
       using a Python script.
