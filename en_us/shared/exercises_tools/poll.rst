##################
Poll Tool for OLX
##################

.. note:: EdX offers provisional support for this tool.

You can run polls in your course so that your students can share opinions on
different questions.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/PollExample.png

.. note:: Creating a poll requires you to export your course, edit some of
 your course's XML files in a text editor, and then re-import your course. We
 recommend that you create a backup copy of your course before you create the
 poll. We also recommend that you only edit the files that will contain polls
 in the text editor if you are very familiar with editing XML.

**************
Terminology
**************

Sections, subsections, units, and components have different names in the
**Course Outline** view and in the list of files that you see after you
export your course and open the .xml files for editing. The following table
lists the names of these elements in the **Course Outline** view and in a list
of files.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15
   :header-rows: 0

   * - Course Outline View
     - File List
   * - Section
     - Chapter
   * - Subsection
     - Sequential
   * - Unit
     - Vertical
   * - Component
     - Discussion, HTML, problem, or video

For example, when you want to find a specific section in your course, you
look in the **Chapter** folder when you open the list of files that your course
contains. To find a unit, you look in the **Vertical** folder.

.. _Create a Poll:

**************
Create a Poll
**************

#. In the unit where you want to create the poll, create components that
   contain all the content that you want *except* for the poll. Make a note of
   the 32-digit unit ID that appears in the **Unit Identifier** field under
   **Unit Location**.

#. Export your course. For information about how to do this, see
   :ref:`Exporting and Importing a Course`. Save the .tar.gz file that contains
   your course in a memorable location so that you can find it easily.

#. Locate the .tar.gz file that contains your course, and then unpack the
   .tar.gz file so that you can see its contents in a list of folders and
   files.

   - To do this on a Windows computer, you need to download a third-party
     program. For more information, see `How to Unpack a tar File in Windows
     <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/How_to_unpack_a_tar_file_in_Windows>`_,
     `How to Extract a Gz File <http://www.wikihow.com/Extract-a-Gz-File>`_,
     `The gzip Home Page <http://www.gzip.org/>`_, or the `Windows
     <http://www.ofzenandcomputing.com/how-to-open-tar-gz-files/#windows>`_
     section of the `How to Open .tar.gz Files
     <http://www.ofzenandcomputing.com/how-to-open-tar-gz-files/>`_ page.

   - For information about how to do this on a Mac, see the `Mac OS X <http://www.ofzenandcomputing.com/how-to-open-tar-gz-files/#mac-os-x>`_ section of the `How to Open .tar.gz Files <http://www.ofzenandcomputing.com/how-to-open-tar-gz-files/>`_ page.

#. In the list of folders and files, open the **Vertical** folder.

   .. note:: If your unit is not published, open the **Drafts** folder, and then open the **Vertical** folder in the **Drafts** folder.

#. In the **Vertical** folder, locate the .xml file that has the same name as
   the unit ID that you noted in step 1, and then open the file in a text
   editor such as Sublime 2. For example, if the unit ID is
   e461de7fe2b84ebeabe1a97683360d31, you open the
   e461de7fe2b84ebeabe1a97683360d31.xml file.

   The file contains a list of all the components in the unit, together with
   the URL names of the components. For example, the following file contains an
   HTML component followed by a discussion component.

   .. code-block:: xml

       <vertical display_name="Test Unit">
        <html url_name="b59c54e2f6fc4cf69ba3a43c49097d0b"/>
        <discussion url_name="8320c3d511484f3b96bdedfd4a44ac8b"/>
       </vertical>

#. Add the following poll code in the location where you want the poll. Change
   the text of the prompt to the text that you want.

   .. code-block:: xml

    <poll_question display_name="Poll Question">
      <p>Text of the prompt</p>
      <answer id="yes">Yes</answer>
      <answer id="no">No</answer>
    </poll_question>

   In the example above, if you wanted your poll to appear between the HTML
   component and the discussion component in the unit, your code would resemble
   the following.

   .. code-block:: xml

     <vertical display_name="Test Unit">
      <html url_name="b59c54e2f6fc4cf69ba3a43c49097d0b"/>
      <poll_question display_name="Poll Question">
        <p>Text of the prompt</p>
        <answer id="yes">Yes</answer>
        <answer id="no">No</answer>
      </poll_question>
      <discussion url_name="8320c3d511484f3b96bdedfd4a44ac8b"/>
     </vertical>

#. After you add the poll code, save and close the .xml file.

#. Re-package your course as a .tar.gz file.

   * For information about how to do this on a Mac, see `How to Create a Tar GZip File from the Command Line <http://osxdaily.com/2012/04/05/create-tar-gzip/>`_.

   * For information about how to do this on a Windows computer, see `How to Make a .tar.gz on Windows <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12774707/how-to-make-a-tar-gz-on-windows>`_.

#. In Studio, re-import your course. You can now review the poll question and
   answers that you added in Studio.

.. note::

  * Although polls render correctly in Studio, you cannot edit them in Studio.
    You will need to follow the export/import process outlined above to make
    any edits to your polls.

  * A .csv file that contains student responses to the problem is not currently
    available for polls. However, you can obtain the aggregate data directly in
    the problem.

*********************
