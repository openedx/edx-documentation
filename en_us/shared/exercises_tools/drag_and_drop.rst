    This drag and drop problem type is intended as a replacement for an older
    drag and drop problem type. This drag and drop problem type includes
    significant improvements and you should use it for any new course
    development. For more information about the previous, deprecated drag and
    drop problem type, see :ref:`Drag and Drop`.

.. _overview_of_drag_and_drop_problems:

**********************************
Overview of Drag and Drop Problems
**********************************

A drag and drop problem includes a background image and one or more items that
learners can drag into target zones on the background image. You can include as
many draggable items and as many target zones as you need. You can include decoy
items that do not have a target and you can include decoy targets that do not
correspond to draggable items.

When learners view a drag and drop problem in the LMS, the problem includes a
top section and a bottom section. Learners drag items from the top section  on
to the background image in the section below it.

The way that a learner selects, or grabs, an item depends on the type of
browser that the learner uses. For example, a learner might click and hold on
a draggable item with a mouse pointer to select it, drag the item to a target,
and release the mouse pointer to drop the item on the target. A learner who
accesses the problem on a mobile device with a touch screen might swipe an item
from the top section into a target zone. A learner who uses a keyboard
interface might use the navigation keys to select an item and then match it to
a target zone.

You can configure a drag and drop problem to give learners unlimited attempts
to match items to target zones or you can configure it to behave restrictively,
like a test.

* In standard mode, the problem gives learners unlimited attempts
  to match items and it provides immediate feedback to indicate whether an item is matched correctly.

* In assessment mode, learners must match all of the draggable items to target
  zones and then submit the problem. The problem does not reveal
  whether items are matched correctly until the learner submits the problem.

For more information about assessment mode and standard mode, see
:ref:`choosing_a_dnd_mode`.

The following image shows an example drag and drop problem.

      and the final feedback message appears below the background image.

.. _drag_and_drop_background_images:

===============================
Understanding Background Images
===============================

The background image for a drag and drop problem is the surface that learners
drag items onto.

A target zone is a rectangular area on the background image. You can show or
hide the borders of a zone for learners. You can add labels for zones or leave
them unlabeled.

A background image must fit within the course screen. The LMS automatically
scales images that are too wide. If you choose a background image that is
extremely large, you should consider how it appears to learners after scaling.
The width of the course screen depends on the device and browsing software that
a learner uses.

You define a target zone by specifying its width, height, horizontal offset
(``x``), and vertical offset (``y``). Each specification is in pixels. The
horizontal offset is the distance between the left side of the background image
and the left side of the target zone. The vertical offset is the distance
between the top of the background image and the top of the target zone.

The following image shows a background image and target zones in the drag and
drop problem editing dialog box. For more information about editing drag and
drop problems, see :ref:`creating_a_drag_and_drop_problem`.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dnd-zone-borders.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: A background image and target zones shown in the drag and drop problem
      editing dialog box.

.. note::
  The pixel coordinates that you use to specify the size and location of target
  zones are also used by common image editing software. You can open a
  background image in an image editing program to find the pixel coordinates of
  a target zone.

.. _drag_and_drop_draggable_items:

==============================
Understanding Draggable Items
==============================

A draggable item is a rectangle that contains either a label or an image.
Learners grab draggable items from the top of a drag and drop problem and drag
them to targets on the background image.

You can set the size of the rectangle for a draggable item as a percentage of
the width of the problem. If you do not specify the size, the LMS sets it based
on the length of the text in the label or the size of the image in it. You can
set the background color and the label text color for the items in a problem.

Each draggable item can match one target zone on the background image, multiple
target zones, or no target zones.

Each item must have a text label to identify it in the drag and drop problem.
If you include only a text label, that label appears in the draggable item. If
you include both a text label and an image for an item, the image appears as
its label.

=================================
Using Draggable Items with Images
=================================

The following image shows draggable items with images. For examples of items
with text, see :ref:`overview_of_drag_and_drop_problems`.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/dnd-draggable-item-images.png
  :width: 400
  :alt: Draggable items with image labels in the item area of a drag and drop
      problem.

Images for draggable items have alternative image descriptions. The alternative
description explains the image content in text. If a learner cannot access the
visual image content, the text description helps that learner to complete the
problem.

Images for draggable items must fit within the top section of the problem. The
LMS automatically scales large images to fit. If you use a large image in a
draggable item, you should consider how that image appears after scaling.

.. note::
    If an image file is unavailable, or cannot be displayed, the LMS displays
    the text description as the button label.

.. _choosing_a_dnd_mode:

=========================================
Choosing a Drag and Drop Problem Mode
=========================================

You can configure drag and drop problems to allow learners to experiment with
matching draggable items to target zones until all items are matched correctly,
or to require that learners match all items to target zones without any input
and then submit their attempts for grading. You can choose either **Standard
Mode** or **Assessment Mode** to control the behavior of the problem.

* In standard mode, learners have unlimited attempts to match
  items and the problem provides immediate feedback to indicate whether
  an item is matched correctly.

* In assessment mode, learners must match all of the draggable items to target
  zones and then choose to submit the problem. The problem does not reveal
  whether items are matched correctly until the learner submits the problem.
  You can limit the number of attempts a learner is allowed, or allow unlimited
  attempts.

.. _using_standard_mode:

Using Standard Mode
********************************************

Standard mode configures a drag and drop problem to give learners unlimited
attempts to match draggable items with target zones until all of the items are
matched to the correct targets. Each time a learner drops an item on a target
zone, the problem reports whether the match is correct. If the match is not
correct, the draggable item is returned to the item bank for a new attempt.

A learner completes a drag and drop problem in standard mode when all of the
items are matched to target zones correctly. Learners receive the maximum score
for the problem when the problem is complete.

.. _using_assessment_mode:

Using Assessment Mode
********************************************

Assessment mode configures a drag and drop problem to behave like a test. In
assessment mode, learners must match all of the draggable items to target zones
before the problem reveals whether the items are matched correctly.

Learners select **Submit** when they believe that they have completed the
problem. If all items are matched correctly, the problem is complete. If any
items are not matched correctly, and the maximum number of attempts has not
been reached, the learner can correct items and select **Submit** again. When
the learner reaches the maximum number of attempts, the problem is complete.

The score for the problem is calculated by dividing the maximum score based on
the percent of draggable items that are matched correctly. If a learner
attempts the problem multiple times, the score for the best attempt is the
final score for the problem.

In assessment mode, you can specify the number of times that learners can
submit a drag and drop problem. If you allow more than one attempt, the problem
reveals which items are correctly matched and gives learners an opportunity to
move items that are not correct. If you do not specify a limit, learners have
unlimited attempts.

.. _enabling_drag_and_drop_problem:

********************************
Enabling Drag and Drop Problems
********************************

Before you can add drag and drop problems, you must enable the drag and drop
problem type for your course.

To enable the drag and drop problem type, you add the ``"drag-and-drop-v2"``
key to the **Advanced Module List** on the **Advanced Settings** page. (Be sure
to include the quotation marks around the key value.) For more information, see
:ref:`Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.

After you enable the ``drag-and-drop-v2`` problem type, **Drag and Drop**
appears in the **Advanced** menu of the **Add New Component** screen.

.. note::
    By default, your course includes a **Drag and Drop** problem type in the
    **Problem > Advanced** menu of the **Add New Component** screen. This is an
    older drag and drop problem type that has been replaced by the ``drag-and-
    drop-v2`` advanced module in the **Advanced** menu of the **Add New
    Component** screen.

.. _creating_a_drag_and_drop_problem:
