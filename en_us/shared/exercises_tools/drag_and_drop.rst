.. note:: EdX offers provisional support for this problem type.

In drag and drop problems, learners respond to a question by dragging text or
objects to a specific location on an image.

.. note::

 * **Drag and drop problems are not accessible for learners with some
   disabilities, and they do not work correctly on mobile phones.** If you use
   this kind of problem, make sure that you include an alternative for
   learners who cannot access drag and drop problems, or leave these problems
   ungraded.

   For more information about creating accessible content, see
   :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for Course Content Development`.

 * The **Show Answer** button does not work for drag and drop problems. By
   default, the **Show Answer** option is set to **Never**. If you change this
   option in the problem component, a **Show Answer** button appears in the
   LMS, but the button does not work.

*********************************
Creating a Drag and Drop Problem
*********************************

To create a simple drag and drop problem in which learners drag labels onto an
image, you upload the image that you want learners to drag labels onto, and
then create a problem component.

#. On the **Files & Uploads** page, upload your image file. For more
   information about uploading files, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.
#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, click **Problem** under
   **Add New Component**, and then click the **Advanced** tab.
#. Click **Drag and Drop**.
#. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. In the component editor, replace the example text with the text of your
   problem.
#. In the ``<drag_and_drop_input>`` tag, replace
   **https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/L9_buckets.png** with the URL
   of your image file on the **Files & Uploads** page (for example,
   **/static/Image.png**).
#. For at least one ``<draggable>`` tag, replace the text of the **label**
   attribute with the text of the label you want learners to drag. For example,
   if you want learners to drag the word "Iceland" onto your image, the new tag
   would resemble the following:

   ``<draggable id="1" label="Iceland"/>``

8. Repeat the previous step for all the labels that you want to use. Make sure
   that the **id** attribute is different for each ``<draggable>`` tag.
#. Determine the coordinates and radius of the correct area on the image.
#. Under ``correct_answer = {``, add an entry for each label, using the
   following format. These values are in pixels:

    ``'id':    [[x coordinate, y coordinate], radius]``

    For example, if your image is 600 pixels wide and 400 pixels high, and you
    want your learners to drag the Iceland label to an area in the upper-left
    part of the image and drag a Sweden label near the lower-right part of your
    image, the code would resemble the following (where 2 is the ID for the
    Sweden label):

    .. code-block:: xml

        correct-answer = {
                '1':    [[50, 50], 75]
                '2':    [[550, 350], 75]}

    .. note:: Make sure the code contains the closing curly brace (**}**).
#. Click **Save**.

==========================================
Sample Drag and Drop Problem Code
==========================================

To create the drag and drop problem that appears in the image above, you
download two files from edX, upload these files to the **Files & Uploads**
page, and then add the code for the problem to a problem component.

#. Download the following files from edX:

  * Allopurinol.gif
  * AllopurinolAnswer.gif

  To download both these files in a .zip archive, click
  http://files.edx.org/DragAndDropProblemFiles.zip.

#. Upload the Allopurinol.gif and AllopurinolAnswer.gif files to the **Files &
   Uploads** page.
#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, click **Problem** under
   **Add New Component**, and then click the **Advanced** tab.
#. Click **Drag and Drop**.
#. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
#. In the component editor, replace the example code with the following code.
#. Click **Save**.

  <problem>
    <p> Allopurinol is a drug used to treat and prevent gout, a very painful form of arthritis. Once only a “rich man’s disease”, gout has become more and more common in recent decades – affecting about 3 million people in the United States alone. Deposits of needle-like crystals of uric acid in connective tissue or joint spaces cause the symptoms of swelling, stiffness and intense pain. Individuals with gout overproduce uric acid because they cannot eliminate it efficiently. Allopurinol treats and prevents gout by stopping the overproduction of uric acid through inhibition of an enzyme required for the synthesis of uric acid. </p>
    <p> You are shown one of many possible molecules. On the structure of allopurinol below, identify the functional groups that are present by dragging the functional group name listed onto the appropriate target boxes on the structure. If you want to change an answer, you have to drag off the name as well. You may need to scroll through the names of functional groups to see all options. </p>

     * ``<draggable>``
     * ``<target>``

**Tag:** ``<draggable>``

Specifies a single draggable object in a drag and drop problem.

A draggable is what the user must drag out of the slider and drop onto the base
image. After a drag operation, if the center of the draggable is located
outside the rectangular dimensions of the image, it will be returned to the
slider.

For the grader to work, each draggable must have a unique ID.

**Tag:** ``<target>``

Specifies the location on the base image where a learner must drop a draggable
item. By design, if the center of a draggable lies within the target (i.e. in
the rectangle defined by [[x, y], [x + w, y + h]],  it is within the target.
Otherwise, it is outside.

If you specify at least one target, and a learner drops a draggable item on a
location that is outside a target, the draggable item returns to the slider.

If you don't specify a target, a learner can drop a draggable item anywhere on
the base image.

**********************
Targets on Draggables
**********************

Sometimes it is not enough to have targets only on the base image, and all of
the draggables on these targets. If a complex problem exists where a draggable
must become itself a target (or many targets), then the following extended
syntax can be used.

::

    ...
    <draggable {attribute list}>
        <target {attribute list} />
        <target {attribute list} />
        <target {attribute list} />
        ...
    </draggable>
    ...

The attribute list in the tags above (``draggable`` and ``target``) is the same
as for normal ``draggable`` and ``target`` tags. The only difference is when
you will be specifying inner target position coordinates. Use the ``x`` and
``y`` attributes to set the offset of the inner target from the upper-left
corner of the parent draggable (that contains the inner target).

=====================================
Limitations of targets on draggables
=====================================

* Currently there is a limitation to the level of nesting of targets.

  Even though you can pile up a large number of draggables on targets that
  themselves are on draggables, the drag and drop problem will be graded only
  if there is a maximum of two levels of targets. The first level are the
  `base` targets. They are attached to the base image. The second level are the
  targets defined on draggables.

* Another limitation is that the target bounds are not checked against other
  targets.

  You must make sure that there is no overlapping of targets. You should also
  ensure that targets on draggables are smaller than the actual parent
  draggable. Technically this is not necessary, but from the usability
  perspective it is desirable.

* You can have targets on draggables only in the case when there are base
  targets defined (base targets are attached to the base image).

  If you do not have base targets, then you can only have a single level of
  nesting (draggables on the base image). In this case the client side will be
  reporting (x,y) positions of each draggable on the base image.

**********************
Correct answer format
**********************

For specifying answers for targets on draggables, see `Answer format for
targets on draggables`_.

There are two correct answer formats: short and long.

In short form, the correct answer is mapping of ``draggable_id`` to
``target_id``::

    correct_answer = {'grass':     [[300, 200], 200], 'ant': [[500, 0], 200]}
    correct_answer = {'name4': 't1', '7': 't2'}

In long form, the correct answer is list of dicts. Every dict has 3 keys:
``draggables``, ``targets`` and ``rule``. For example::

    correct_answer = [
    {
      'draggables':   ['7', '8'],
      'targets':  ['t5_c', 't6_c'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    },
    {
      'draggables': ['1', '2'],
      'targets': ['t2_h', 't3_h', 't4_h', 't7_h', 't8_h', 't10_h'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    }]

"Draggables" is the list of draggable IDs. "Target" is the list of target IDs
that draggables must be dragged to.

.. Caution::
  Draggables in dicts inside the ``correct_answer`` list must not intersect.

Wrong (for draggable id 7)::

    correct_answer = [
    {
      'draggables':   ['7', '8'],
      'targets':  ['t5_c', 't6_c'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    },
    {
      'draggables': ['7', '2'],
      'targets': ['t2_h', 't3_h', 't4_h', 't7_h', 't8_h', 't10_h'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    }]

The values for ``rule`` follow.

* ``exact``: Targets for draggable IDs in ``user_answer`` are the same as
  targets from the correct answer. For example, for draggables 7 and 8, the
  user must drag 7 to target1 and 8 to target2 if the ``correct_answer`` is::

    correct_answer = [
      {
      'draggables':   ['7', '8'],
      'targets':  ['tartget1', 'target2'],
      'rule': 'exact'
    }]


* ``unordered_equal``: Allows draggables be dragged to targets unordered. For
  learners to drag 7 to target1 or target2 and 8 to target2 or target1 and 7
  and 8 must be in different targets, then correct answer must be::

    correct_answer = [
    {
      'draggables':   ['7', '8'],
      'targets':  ['tartget1', 'target2'],
      'rule': 'unordered_equal'
    }]


* ``anyof``: Allows draggables to be dragged to any target. For learners to
  drag 7 and 8 to target1 or target2, any of these are correct with the `anyof`
  rule::

    correct_answer = [
    {
      'draggables':   ['7', '8'],
      'targets':  ['tartget1', 'target2'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    }]

If ``can_reuse`` is true, then you have draggables a,b,c and 10 targets. These
will allow you to drag 4 ``a`` draggables to [``target1``,  ``target4``,
``target7``, ``target10``]; you do not need to write ``a`` four times. Also
this will allow you to drag the ``b`` draggable to target2 or target5 for
target5 and target2.::

    correct_answer = [
        {
          'draggables': ['a'],
          'targets': ['target1',  'target4', 'target7', 'target10'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['b'],
          'targets': ['target2', 'target5', 'target8'],
          'rule': 'anyof'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['c'],
          'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        }]

Sometimes you want to allow learners to drag only two ``b`` draggables. In this
case you should use the ``anyof+number`` or ``unordered_equal+number`` rule::

    correct_answer = [
        {
          'draggables': ['a', 'a', 'a'],
          'targets': ['target1',  'target4', 'target7'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal+number'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['b', 'b'],
          'targets': ['target2', 'target5', 'target8'],
          'rule': 'anyof+number'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['c'],
          'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        }]

When there are no multiple draggables per targets (one_per_target=``true``),
for the same number of draggables, ``anyof`` is equal to ``unordered_equal``.

If ``can_reuse=true``, then you must use only the long form of the correct
answer.

=======================================
Answer format for targets on draggables
=======================================

As with the cases described above, an answer must provide precise positioning
for each draggable (on which targets it must reside). In the case when a
draggable must be placed on a target that itself is on a draggable, then the
answer must contain the chain of target-draggable-target.

For example, suppose we have three draggables - ``up``, ``s``, and ``p``.
Draggables ``s`` and ``p`` have targets on themselves. More specifically,
``p`` has three targets - ``1``, ``2``, and ``3``. The first requirement is
that ``s`` and ``p`` are positioned on specific targets on the base image. The
second requirement is that draggable ``up`` is positioned on specific targets
of draggable ``p``. Below is an excerpt from a problem::

    <draggable id="up" icon="/static/images/images_list/lcao-mo/up.png" can_reuse="true" />

    <draggable id="s" icon="/static/images/images_list/lcao-mo/orbital_single.png" label="s orbital" can_reuse="true" >
        <target id="1" x="0" y="0" w="32" h="32"/>
    </draggable>

    <draggable id="p" icon="/static/images/images_list/lcao-mo/orbital_triple.png" can_reuse="true" label="p orbital" >
      <target id="1" x="0" y="0" w="32" h="32"/>
      <target id="2" x="34" y="0" w="32" h="32"/>
      <target id="3" x="68" y="0" w="32" h="32"/>
    </draggable>

    ...

    correct_answer = [
        {
          'draggables': ['p'],
          'targets': ['p-left-target', 'p-right-target'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['s'],
          'targets': ['s-left-target', 's-right-target'],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        },
        {
          'draggables': ['up'],
          'targets': ['p-left-target[p][1]', 'p-left-target[p][2]', 'p-right-
             target[p][2]', 'p-right-target[p][3]',],
          'rule': 'unordered_equal'
        }
    ]

Note that you must specify rules for all draggables, even if a draggable gets
included in more than one chain.

*************
Grading logic
*************

#. The learner's answer and the correct answer are parsed to the same format.
   ::

    group_id: group_draggables, group_targets, group_rule

  ``group_id`` is ordinal number, for every dict in correct answer incremental
  ``group_id`` is assigned: 0, 1, 2, ...

  Draggables from the user answer are added to the same group_id where
  identical draggables from the correct answer are, for example::

    If correct_draggables[group_0] = [t1, t2] then
    user_draggables[group_0] are all draggables t1 and t2 from the user answer:
    [t1] or [t1, t2] or [t1, t2, t2] etc..

#. For every group from the user answer, for that group's draggables, if
   ``number`` is in the group rule, set() is applied. If ``number`` is not in
   rule, set is not applied::

    set() : [t1, t2, t3, t3] -> [t1, t2, ,t3]

  For every group, at this step, draggables lists are equal.

#. For every group, lists of targets are compared using the rule for that
   group.

==========================
Set and ``+number`` cases
==========================

``set()`` and ``+number`` are needed only for the case of reusable draggables.
For other cases there are no equal draggables in list, so set() does nothing.

* The ``set()`` operation allows you to create a rule for the case of "any
  number of the same draggable can be dragged to targets"::

    {
      'draggables': ['draggable_1'],
      'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
      'rule': 'anyof'
    }

* The ``number`` rule is used for the case of reusable draggables, when you
  want to fix number of draggable to drag. In this example only two instances
  of draggables_1 are allowed to be dragged::

    {
      'draggables': ['draggable_1', 'draggable_1'],
      'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
      'rule': 'anyof+number'
    }


* Note, that in using rule ``exact``, one does not need ``number``, because you
  cannot recognize from the user interface which reusable draggable is on which
  target. For example::

    {
      'draggables': ['draggable_1', 'draggable_1', 'draggable_2'],
      'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
      'rule': 'exact'
    }


    Correct handling of this example is to create different rules for
    draggable_1 and draggable_2.

* For ``unordered_equal`` (or ``exact``) you don't need ``number`` if you have
  only the same draggable in the group, as the target length will provide
  the constraint for the number of draggables::

    {
      'draggables': ['draggable_1'],
      'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
      'rule': 'unordered_equal'
    }

  This means that only ``draggable_1`` can be dragged.

* But if you have more than one different reusable draggable in the list, you
  may use the ``number`` rule::

    {
      'draggables': ['draggable_1', 'draggable_1', 'draggable_2'],
      'targets': ['target3', 'target6', 'target9'],
      'rule': 'unordered_equal+number'
    }

If you do not use ``number``, the draggables list will be set to
[``draggable_1``, ``draggable_2``].
