.. note:: EdX does not support this problem type.

.. warning:: This problem type is a prototype, and is not supported. By
 default, the ability to create these problems is not enabled in Studio. You
 must change the advanced settings in your course before you can create
 problems with LaTeX. Use this problem type with caution.

If you have an problem that is already written in LaTeX, you can use this
problem type to easily convert your code into XML. After you paste your code
into the LaTeX editor, you make a few adjustments.

.. note:: If you want to use LaTeX to typeset mathematical expressions
          in problems that you haven't yet written, use any of the other
          problem templates together with `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org>`_.
          For more information about how to create mathematical expressions in
          Studio using MathJax, see *A Brief Introduction to MathJax in
          Studio*.
