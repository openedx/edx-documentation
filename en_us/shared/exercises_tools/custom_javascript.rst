Custom JavaScript Display and Grading Problem
##############################################

.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called custom JavaScript
problems or JS input problems) allow you to create a custom problem or tool
that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or tool directly into Studio.
When you create a JS input problem, Studio embeds the problem in an inline
frame (an HTML iframe element) so that your learners can interact with it in
the LMS. You can grade your learnersâ€™ work using JavaScript and some basic
Python, and the grading is integrated into the edX grading system.

The JS input problem that you create must use HTML, JavaScript, and cascading
style sheets (CSS). You can use any application creation tool, such as the
Google Web Toolkit (GWT), to create your JS input problem.

.. caution::

  * You cannot use a custom JavaScript problem in a component that contains
    more than one problem. Each custom JavaScript problem must be in its own
    component. See :ref:`Multiple Problems in One Component` for more
    information.

  * The **Show Answer** button does not work for JS input problems. By
    default, the **Show Answer** option is set to **Never**. If you change
    this option in the problem component, a **Show Answer** button appears in
    the learner's view of the problem in the LMS, but the button does not work.


************************************************************
Create a Custom JavaScript Display and Grading Problem
************************************************************

#. Create your JavaScript application, and then upload all files associated
   with that application to the **Files & Uploads** page.
#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem** , and then select **Advanced**.
#. Select **Custom JavaScript Display and Grading**.
#. In the component that appears, select **Edit**.

#. In the component editor, modify the example code according to your problem.
   Be sure to specify a ``title`` attribute on the ``jsinput`` tag. This title
   is used for the title attribute on the generated inline frame.

#. (Optional) To add a **Save** button to your problem, select **Settings**, and
   then set **Maximum Attempts** to a number larger than zero.

#. Select **Save**.


.. note::  All problems include more than one resource. If all the resources in
   a problem have the same protocol, host, and port, then the problem conforms
   to the same-origin policy (SOP). For example, the resources
   ``http://store.company.com:81/subdirectory_1/JSInputElement.html`` and
   ``http://store.company.com:81/subdirectory_2/JSInputElement.js`` have the
   same protocol (``http``), host (``store.company.com``), and port (``81``).

   If any resources in your problem use a different protocol, host, or port,
   you need to bypass the SOP. For example,
   ``https://info.company.com/JSInputElement2.html`` uses a different
   protocol, host, and port from
   ``http://store.company.com:81/subdirectory_1/JSInputElement.html``.

   To bypass the SOP, change ``sop="true"`` to ``sop="false"``. In the example
   problem code, this attribute is just before the closing ``customresponse``
   tag.

   If you bypass the same-origin policy, you require an additional file.
   The example problem uses the file ``jschannel.js`` to bypass the SOP.

   For more information, see the same-origin policy page on the `Mozilla
   Developer Network site <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
   US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript>`_ or on
   `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy>`_.

.. note:: Keep the following points in mind about this example problem.

 - The jsinput_example.js file defines three JavaScript functions
   (**JSInputDemo.getGrade**, **JSInputDemo.getState**, and
   **JSInputDemo.setState**).

 - The JavaScript input problem code uses **JSInputDemo.getGrade**,
   **JSInputDemo.getState**, and **JSInputDemo.setState** to grade, save, or
   restore a problem. These functions must be global in scope.

 - **JSInputDemo.getState** and **JSInputDemo.setState** are optional. You
   need to define these functions only if you want to conserve the state of
   the problem.

 - **Width** and **height** represent the dimensions of the inline frame that
   holds the application.

 - The response is graded as correct if the ``correct`` option is selected in
   the dropdown control when the user selects **Submit**.

 - Selecting **Submit** registers the problem's current state.


.. _JS Input Problem XML:

******************************
JavaScript Input Problem XML
******************************

JSInput allows problem authors to turn stand-alone HTML files into problems
that can be integrated into the edX platform. Since its aim is flexibility, it
can be seen as the input and client-side equivalent of **CustomResponse**.

A JSInput exercise creates an inline frame (iframe) in a static HTML page, and
passes the return value of author-specified functions to the enclosing
response type (generally **CustomResponse**). JSInput can also store and
retrieve state.

========
Template
========

The following is the basic format of a JSInput problem.

.. code-block:: xml

 <problem>
        <script type="loncapa/python">
            def all_true(exp, ans): return ans == "hi"
        </script>
        <customresponse cfn="all_true">
            <jsinput gradefn="gradefn"
                height="500"
                get_statefn="getstate"
                set_statefn="setstate"
                html_file="/static/jsinput.html"
                title="iframe Title"/>
        </customresponse>
 </problem>

The accepted attributes are:

==============  ==============  =========  ==========
Attribute Name   Value Type     Required   Default
==============  ==============  =========  ==========
html_file        URL string     Yes        None
title            string         Yes        ``Problem Remote Content``
gradefn          Function name  Yes        ``gradefn``
set_statefn      Function name  No         None
get_statefn      Function name  No         None
height           Integer        No         ``300``
width            Integer        No         ``400``
title            String         No         None
==============  ==============  =========  ==========

========================
Required Attributes
========================

* **html_file**

  The **html_file** attribute specifies the HTML file that the iframe will
  point to. The HTML file must be located in the content directory.

  The iframe is created using the sandbox attribute. Although pop-ups,
  scripts, and pointer locks are allowed, the iframe cannot access its
  parent's attributes.

  The HTML file must contain a **gradefn** function that the JSInput file can
  access. To determine whether the **gradefn** function is accessible, in the
  console, make sure that **gradefn** returns the right thing. When JSInput
  uses the **gradefn** function, `gradefn` is called with
  `gradefn`.call(`obj`), where **obj** is the object-part of **gradefn**. For
  example, if **gradefn** is **myprog.myfn**, JSInput calls
  **myprog.myfun.call(myprog)**.

  The HTML file has no specific requirements other than the **gradefn**
  function. Note that inheriting CSS or JavaScript from the parent (except for
  the Chrome-only **seamless** attribute, which is set to ``True`` by default)
  is not currently supported.

* **title**

  The **title** attribute specifies the title for the generated iframe.
  Generally, the title attribute on the iframe should match the title tag of
  the HTML file that is hosted within the iframe.

* **gradefn**

  The **gradefn** attribute specifies the name of the function that will be
  called when a user selects **Submit**, and that returns the learner's answer.
  Unless both the **get_statefn** and **set_statefn** attributes are also
  used, this answer is passed as a string to the enclosing response type. In
  the **customresponse** example above, this means **cfn** will be passed this
  answer as ``ans``.

  If the **gradefn** function throws an exception when a learner attempts to
  submit a problem, the submission is aborted, and the learner receives a
  generic alert. The alert can be customized by making the exception name
  ``Waitfor Exception``; in that case, the alert message will be the exception
  message.

  .. important:: To make sure the learner's latest answer is passed correctly,
    make sure that the **gradefn** function is not asynchronous. Additionally,
    make sure that the function returns promptly. Currently the learner has no
    indication that her answer is being calculated or produced.

========================
Optional Attributes
========================

* **set_statefn**

  Sometimes a problem author will want information about a learner's previous
  answers ("state") to be saved and reloaded. If the attribute **set_statefn**
  is used, the function given as its value will be passed the state as a
  string argument whenever there is a state, and the learner returns to a
  problem. The function has the responsibility to then use this state
  appropriately.

  The state that is passed is:

  * The previous output of **gradefn** (i.e., the previous answer) if
    **get_statefn** is not defined.
  * The previous output of **get_statefn** (see below) otherwise.

  It is the responsibility of the iframe to do proper verification of the
  argument that it receives via **set_statefn**.

* **get_statefn**

  Sometimes the state and the answer are quite different. For instance, a
  problem that involves using a JavaScript program that allows the learner to
  alter a molecule may grade based on the molecule's hydrophobicity, but from
  the hydrophobicity it might be incapable of restoring the state. In that
  case, a *separate* state may be stored and loaded by **set_statefn**. Note
  that if **get_statefn** is defined, the answer (i.e., what is passed to the
  enclosing response type) will be a json string with the following format:

  .. code-block:: xml

      {
          answer: `[answer string]`
          state: `[state string]`
      }


  The enclosing response type must then parse this as json.

* **height** and **width**

  The **height** and **width** attributes are straightforward: they specify
  the height and width of the iframe. Both are limited by the enclosing DOM
  elements, so for instance there is an implicit max-width of around 900.

  In the future, JSInput may attempt to make these dimensions match the HTML
  file's dimensions (up to the aforementioned limits), but currently it
  defaults to ``300`` and ``400`` for **height** and **width**, respectively.
