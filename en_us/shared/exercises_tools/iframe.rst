IFrame Tool
##################

An IFrame allows you to integrate ungraded exercises and tools from any Internet site into the body of your course. The IFrame appears inside an HTML component, and the exercise or tool appears inside the IFrame. IFrames can include your own tools or third-party tools.

IFrames are well-suited for tools that demonstrate a concept but that won't be graded or store student data. If you want to add a graded tool or exercise, add the tool as a :ref:`custom JavaScript problem<Custom JavaScript>` or an :ref:`LTI component<LTI Component>`. 

For more information about IFrames, see the `IFrame specification <http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/iframe>`_.

****************************
Create an IFrame Tool
****************************

To add an exercise or tool in an IFrame, you'll create an IFrame HTML component and add the URL of the page that contains the exercise or tool to the component. You can also add text and images both before and after the IFrame.

.. note:: The URL of the page that contains the exercise or tool must start with ``https`` instead of ``http``. If the URL starts with ``http``, you have to work with the owner of that page to find out if an ``https`` version is available. Some websites do not allow their content to be embedded in IFrames.

#. Under **Add New Component**, click **html**, and then click **IFrame**.

#. In the new component that appears, click **Edit**.

#. In the toolbar in the component editor, click **HTML**.

#. In the HTML source code editor, locate the following HTML (line 7). This HTML includes the ``<iframe>`` element:

   .. code-block:: html

      <p><iframe src="https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/eulerLineDemo.html" width="402" height="402" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0" scrolling="no">You need an iFrame capable browser to view this.</iframe></p>

5. Replace the default URL in the **src** attribute (**https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/eulerLineDemo.html**) with the URL of the page that contains the exercise or tool. **This URL must start with https**. Make sure you don't delete the quotation marks that surround the URL.

#. Change the attributes in the IFrame element to specify any other settings that you want. For more information about these settings, see :ref:`IFrame Settings`. You can also change the text between the opening and closing ``<iframe>`` tags. A student only sees this text if the student uses a browser that does not support IFrames.

7. Click **OK** to close the HTML source code editor and return to the Visual editor.

#. In the Visual editor, replace the default text with your own text.

#. Click **Save**.

======================
IFrame Settings
======================

To specify settings for your IFrame, you'll add, remove, or change the attributes inside the opening ``<iframe>`` tag. The ``<iframe>`` tag **must** contain a **src** attribute that specifies the URL of the web page you want. Other attributes are optional. 

You can add these attributes in any order you want.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1
 
   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - **src** (required)
     - Specifies the URL of the page that contains the exercise or tool.
   * - **width** and **height** (optional)
     - Specify the width and height of the IFrame, in pixels or as a percentage. To specify the value in pixels, enter numerals. To specify a percentage, enter numerals followed by a percent sign.

       If you don't specify the width and height, the IFrame uses the dimensions that the linked page has set. These dimensions vary by website. If you change the width and height of the IFrame, the content from the linked page may be resized, or only part of the content may appear.

   * - **marginwidth** and **marginheight** (optional)
     - Specify the size of the space between the edges of the IFrame and your exercise or tool, in pixels.
   * - **frameborder** (optional)
     - Specifies whether a border appears around your IFrame. If the value is 0, no border appears. If the value is any positive number, a border appears.
   * - **scrolling** (optional)
     - Specifies whether a scrollbar appears to help users see all of the IFrame's content if your IFrame is smaller than the exercise or tool it contains. For example, if the content in your IFrame is very tall, you can set the IFrame's height to a smaller number and add a vertical scroll bar for users, as in the first image below.

For example, compare how the different settings in each of the ``<iframe>`` elements below affect the IFrame. 

.. code-block:: html

      <p><iframe src="https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/eulerLineDemo.html" width="442" height="200" marginwidth="20" marginheight="20" frameborder="1" scrolling="yes">You need an iFrame capable browser to view this.</iframe></p>
