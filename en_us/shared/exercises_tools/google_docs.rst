This topic describes how to embed Google Drive files, such as documents,

Before you make content from an external site available through your course, be
sure to review the content to ensure that it is accessible to people with
disabilities. For more information, see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for
Course Content Development`.

You can also use :ref:`Google calendars<Google Calendar Tool>` in the course
body. For more information, see :ref:`Google Calendar Tool`.

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries. If
  Google services are not available in a learner's area, the learner might see
  an "image unavailable" message in the place of the Google Drive file or
  calendar. EdX strongly suggests that you provide alternative resources for
  learners in these areas.

*********
Overview
*********

You can embed a Google Drive file in your course so that learners see the file
in the course body. For example, you can share a Google spreadsheet with
learners.

You can embed the following types of Google Drive files.

* Google Docs (text documents)
* Google Drawings (images)
* Google Forms (forms or surveys)
* Google Slides (presentations)
* Google Sheets (spreadsheets)

Embedding a Google Drive File in Your Course
********************************************

To embed a Google Drive file in your course, follow these steps.

.. _Enable the Google Drive Files Tool:

==================================================
Enable the Google Drive Files Tool
==================================================

Before you can add Google Drive files to your course, you must enable the
Google Drive tool in Studio or OLX (open learning XML).

To enable the Google Drive tool in Studio, you add the ``"google-document"``
key to the **Advanced Module List** on the **Advanced Settings** page. For
more information, see :ref:`Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.

Alternatively, you can use OLX to enable the Google Drive tool.

.. _Enable Google Drive Files in OLX:

Enable Google Drive Files in OLX
********************************

To enable Google Drive files in your course, you edit the XML file that
defines the course structure. You locate the ``course`` element's
``advanced-modules`` attribute, and add the string ``google-document``
to it.

For example, the following XML code enables Google Drive files in a course. It
also enables Google calendars.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course advanced_modules="[&quot;google-document&quot;,
      &quot;google-calendar&quot;]" display_name="Sample Course"
      start="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z">
      ...
  </course>

For more information, see :ref:`olx:OLX Course Building Blocks` in the
*EdX Open Learning XML Guide*.

.. _Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code:

=======================================================
Publish the Google Drive File and Obtain the Embed Code
=======================================================

Before you can add a Google Drive file to your course, you must publish the
file to the web and obtain the embed code for the file.

.. important::
 The task described in this section relies on the use of third-party software.
 Because the software is subject to change by its owner, the steps provided
 here are intended as guidelines and not as an exact procedure.

#. Open the Google Drive file.
#. From the **File** menu, select **Publish to the web**.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-publish-to-web.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file Publish to the web dialog box.

#. Select **Publish**, and then select **OK** to confirm the action.
#. Select the **Embed** tab.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-embed.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file Publish to web Embed tab

#. Copy the complete string in the **Embed** field, including the ``<iframe>``
   tags.

   .. note::
    Google images do not have an ``<iframe>`` tag. To embed an image, you copy
    the complete ``img`` tag.

   You use that string to configure the Google Drive file component.

.. _Add a Google Drive File to Your Course:

========================================
Add a Google Drive File to Your Course
========================================

To add a Google Drive file in the course body, you create an advanced
component in Studio or create a Google Document XBlock in OLX.

.. _Add a Google Drive File Component in edX Studio:

Add a Google Drive File Component in edX Studio
******************************************************

Ensure you :ref:`enable Google Drive files<Enable the Google Drive Files Tool>`
before you add the component.

To add a Google Drive file component, follow these steps.

#. On the Course Outline page, open the unit where you want to add the Google
   Drive component.

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **Advanced**, and then select **Google
   Document**.

   The new component is added to the unit, with the default Google presentation
   embedded.

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.

#. In the **Display Name** field, enter the name for the component.

#. In the **Embed Code** field, paste the embed code that you copied in the
   `Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code`_ task.

#. Select **Save**.

You can then :ref:`Preview Course Content` to see how the unit with the Google
drive file will appear to learners.

.. _Add a Google Drive File XBlock in OLX:

Add a Google Drive File XBlock in OLX
*******************************************

To add a Google Drive file XBlock in OLX, you create the
``google-document`` element. You can embed the ``google-document``
element in the ``vertical`` element, or you can create the
``google-document`` element as a stand-alone file that you reference
in the vertical.

For more information, see :ref:`olx:OLX Course Building Blocks` in the
*EdX Open Learning XML Guide*.

For example:

.. code-block:: xml

  <google-document url_name="c5804436419148f68e2ee44abd396b12"
    embed_code="&lt;iframe
    frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub
    ?key=0AuZ_5O2JZpH5dGVUVDNGUE05aTFNcEl2Z0ZuTUNmWUE&amp;output=html&amp;widge
    t=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" display_name="Google Document"/>

The value of the ``embed_code`` attribute is the embed code you copied in the
`Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code`_ task.

.. note::
  The edX Learning Management System sets the height and width values for
  Google Drive files. If you add these attributes, the LMS overrides your
  changes.

**************************
Editing Google Drive Files
**************************

When you edit and save a Google Drive file that is embedded in your course,
learners see the updates immediately. You make changes to files with the
Google user interface. You do not need to edit the Google Document component.
