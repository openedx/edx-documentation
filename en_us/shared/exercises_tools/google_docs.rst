You can embed a Google Drive file in your course so that students see the file in
the courseware. For example, you can share a Google spreadsheet with students.

Embedding a Google Drive File in Your Course
********************************************

Embedding a Google Drive file in your course has three steps:

#. :ref:`Enable Google Drive files in your course<Enable Google Drive Files in
   Your Course>` by using :ref:`Studio<Enable Google Drive Files in edX Studio>`
   or :ref:`OLX<Enable Google Drive Files in OLX>`.

#. `Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code`_.

#. :ref:`Add the Google Drive file to your course<Add a Google Drive File to Your
   Course>` by using :ref:`Studio<Add a Google Drive File Component in edX
   Studio>` or :ref:`OLX<Add a Google Drive File XBlock in OLX>`.


.. _Enable Google Drive Files in Your Course:

========================================
Enable Google Drive Files in Your Course
========================================

You can enable Google Drive files in the course by using either Studio or OLX.

.. _Enable Google Drive Files in edX Studio:

Enable Google Drive Files in edX Studio
***************************************

To enable Google Drive files in your course:

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Advanced Module List** field, place your cursor between the braces,
   and then type ``"google-document"``. If you see other values in this field,
   add a comma after the closing quotation mark for the last value, and then
   type ``"google-document"``. For example:
   
   .. image:: ../Images/google-advanced-setting.png
    :alt: Advanced modules setting for Google documents

#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.


.. _Enable Google Drive Files in OLX:

Enable Google Drive Files in OLX
********************************

To enable Google Drive files in your course, you edit the XML file that
defines the course structure. You locate the ``course`` element's 
``advanced-modules`` attribute, and add the string ``google-document`` 
to it.

For example, the following XML code enables Google Drive files in a course. It
also enables Google calendars.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course advanced_modules="[&quot;google-document&quot;, 
      &quot;google-calendar&quot;]" display_name="Sample Course" 
      start="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z">
      ...
  </course>

For more information, see `The Courseware Structure`_.

.. _Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code:

=======================================================
Publish the Google Drive File and Obtain the Embed Code
=======================================================

Before you can add a Google Drive file to your course, you must publish the
file to the web and obain the embed code for the file.

.. important:: 
 The task described in this section relies on the use of third-party software.
 Because the software is subject to change by its owner, the steps provided
 here are intended as guidelines and not as an exact procedure.

#. Open the Google Drive file.
#. From the **File** menu, select **Publish to the web**.
   
   .. image:: ../Images/google-publish-to-web.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file Publish to the web dialog box

#. Click **Publish**, then select **OK** to confirm the action.
#. Click the **Embed** tab.
      
   .. image:: ../Images/google-embed.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file Publish to web Embed tab

#. Copy the complete string in the **Embed** field, including the ``<iframe>``
   tags.

   .. note::  
    Google images do not have an ``<iframe>`` tag. To embed an image, you copy
    the complete ``img`` tag.

   You use that string to configure the Google Drive file component.

.. _Add a Google Drive File to Your Course:

========================================
Add a Google Drive File to Your Course
========================================

To add a Google Drive file in the courseware, you create an advanced
component in Studio or create a Google Document Xblock in OLX.

.. _Add a Google Drive File Component in edX Studio:

Add a Google Drive File Component in edX Studio
******************************************************

Ensure you :ref:`enable Google Drive files<Enable Google Drive Files in edX
Studio>` before you add the component.

To add a Google Drive file component:

#. On the Course Outline page, open the unit where you want to add the Google
   Drive component.

#. Under **Add New Component** click **Advanced**, and then select **Google
   Document**.
   
   The new component is added to the unit, with the default Google presentation
   embedded.

   .. image:: ../Images/google-document-studio.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file component in a unit page

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.
   
   .. image:: ../Images/google-document-edit-studio.png
    :alt: The Google Drive file editor

#. In the **Display Name** field, type the name for the component.

#. In the **Embed Code** field, paste the embed code you copied in the 
   `Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code`_ task.

#. Click **Save**.

You can then :ref:`Preview Course Content` to see how the unit with the Google
drive file will appear to students.

.. _Add a Google Drive File XBlock in OLX:

Add a Google Drive File XBlock in OLX
*******************************************

To add a Google Drive file XBlock in OLX, you create the 
``google-document`` element. You can embed the ``google-document`` 
element in the ``vertical`` element, or you can create the 
``google-document`` element as a stand-alone file that you reference 
in the vertical.

For more information, see `The Courseware Structure`_.

For example:

.. code-block:: xml

  <google-document url_name="c5804436419148f68e2ee44abd396b12"
    embed_code="&lt;iframe 
    frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub
    ?key=0AuZ_5O2JZpH5dGVUVDNGUE05aTFNcEl2Z0ZuTUNmWUE&amp;output=html&amp;widge
    t=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" display_name="Google Document"/>

The value of the ``embed_code`` attribute is the embed code you copied in the
`Obtain the Google Drive File Embed Code`_ task.

.. note:: 
  The edX Learning Management System sets the height and width values for
  Google Drive files. If you add these attributes, the LMS overrides your
  changes.

**************************
Editing Google Drive Files
**************************

When you edit and save a Google Drive file that is embedded in your course,
students see the updates immediately. You make changes to files with the
Google user interface. You do not need to edit the Google Document component.
