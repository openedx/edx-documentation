Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem
***************************************

You can add feedback, hints, or both to the following core problem types.

* :ref:`Checkbox`
* :ref:`Dropdown`
* :ref:`Multiple Choice`
* :ref:`Numerical Input`
* :ref:`Text Input`

By using hints and feedback, you can provide learners with guidance and help as
they work on problems.

==========================================
Feedback in Response to Attempted Answers
==========================================

You can add feedback that displays to learners after they submit an answer.

For example, the following multiple choice problem provides feedback in
response to the selected option when the learner selects **Submit**. In this
case, feedback is given for an incorrect answer.

Best Practices for Providing Feedback
==========================================

The immediacy of the feedback available to learners is a key advantage of
online instruction and difficult to do in a traditional classroom environment.

You can target feedback for common incorrect answers to the misconceptions that
are common for the level of the learner (for example, elementary, middle, high
school, college).

In addition, you can create feedback that provides some guidance to the
learner about how to arrive at the correct answer. This is especially important
in text input and numeric input problems, because without such guidance,
learners might not be able to proceed.

You should also include feedback for the correct answer to reinforce why the
answer is correct. Especially in questions where learners are able to guess,
such as multiple choice and dropdown problems, the feedback should provide a
reason why the selection is correct.

============================
Providing Hints for Problems
============================

You can add one or more hints that are displayed to learners. When you add
hints, the **Hint** button is automatically displayed to learners. Learners can
access the hints by selecting **Hint** beneath the problem.  A learner can view
multiple hints by selecting **Hint** multiple times.

For example, in the following multiple choice problem, the learner selects
**Hint** after having made one incorrect attempt.

The hint text indicates that it is the first of two hints. After the learner
selects **Next Hint**, both of the available hints appear. When all hints have
been used, the **Hint** or **Next Hint** option is no longer available.

==========================================
Best Practices for Providing Hints
==========================================

To ensure that your hints can assist learners with varying backgrounds and
levels of understanding, you should provide multiple hints with different
levels of detail.

For example, the first hint can orient the learner to the problem and help
those struggling to better understand what is being asked.

The second hint can then take the learner further towards the answer.

In problems that are not graded, the third and final hint can explain the
solution for learners who are still confused.

==========================================
Create Problems with Feedback and Hints
==========================================

You create problems with feedback and hints in Studio. Templates with feedback
and hints configured are available to make creating your own problems easier.

While editing a unit, in the **Add New Component** panel, select **Problem**.
In the list that opens, select  **Common Problem Types**. Templates for
problems with feedback and hints are listed.

Add the problem type you need to the unit, then edit the component.  The exact
syntax you use to configure hints and feedback depends on the problem type.
See the topic for the problem type for more information.
