Before you make content from an external site available through your course, be
sure to review the content to ensure that it is accessible to people with
disabilities. For more information, see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for
Course Content Development`.

You can also add Google Drive files, such as documents, spreadsheets, and
images, to your course. For more information, see :ref:`Google Drive Files
Tool`.

.. note:: Google services are not available in some regions and countries.
  If Google services are not available in a learner's area, the learner might
  see an "image unavailable" message in the place of the Google Drive file or
  Google Calendar. EdX strongly suggests that you provide alternative resources
  for learners in these areas.

Overview
*********

You can embed a Google Calendar in your course so that learners see the
calendar in the course body. You can use a Google Calendar to share quiz dates,
office hours, or other schedules of interest to learners. For example:

.. _Enable the Google Calendars Tool:

================================================
Enable the Google Calendars Tool
================================================

Before you can add Google Calendars to your course, you must enable the Google
Calendars tool in Studio or OLX (open learning XML).

To enable the Google Calendars tool in Studio, you add the
``"google-calendar"`` key to the **Advanced Module List** on the **Advanced
Settings** page. (Be sure to include the quotation marks around the key
value.) For more information, see :ref:`Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.

Alternatively, you can use OLX to enable the Google Calendars tool.

.. _Enable Google Calendars in OLX:

Enable Google Calendars in OLX
**********************************************

To enable Google Calendars in your course, you edit the XML file that defines
the course structure. You locate the ``course`` element's ``advanced-modules``
attribute, and add the string ``google-calendar`` to it.

For example, the following XML code enables Google Calendars in a course. It
also enables Google Drive files.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course advanced_modules="[&quot;google-document&quot;,
      &quot;google-calendar&quot;]" display_name="Sample Course"
      start="2014-01-01T00:00:00Z">
      ...
  </course>

For more information, see :ref:`olx:OLX Course Building Blocks` in the
*EdX Open Learning XML Guide*.

===================================================
Make the Google Calendar Public and Obtain Its ID
===================================================

Before you can add a Google Calendar to your course, you must make the Calendar
public and obtain its ID.

.. important::
 The tasks described in this section rely on the use of third-party software.
 Because the software is subject to change by its owner, the steps provided
 here are intended as guidelines and not as an exact procedure.

Make the Google Calendar Public
**********************************************

#. Open the Google Calendar.
#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Settings**.
#. Select the **Calendars** tab.

   You might have multiple calendars on the **Calendars** tab. Find the
   calendar that you want to share in your course.

#. In the row for the calendar to share, in the **Sharing** column, select
   **Edit Settings**.
#. Select the **Share this Calendar** tab, and then select **Make this calendar
   public**.

  .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-calendar-settings.png
   :alt: Google Calendar settings.

#. Select **Save**.

   The **Calendar Settings** page closes, and you return to the **Calendars**
   tab. You continue by :ref:`obtaining the Google Calendar's ID<Obtain the
   Google Calendar ID>`.

.. _Obtain the Google Calendar ID:

Obtain the Google Calendar ID
**********************************************

#. On the **Calendars** tab, select the name of the calendar.
#. Select the **Calendar Details** tab.
#. Next to the **Calendar Address** label, look to the right of the three
   colored **XML**, **ICAL**, and **HTML** buttons. In parentheses, you can see
   the calendar ID.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-calendar-address.png
     :width: 600
     :alt: Image of Calendar Address label with the calendar ID to the right.

   The calendar ID resembles the following text.

   ``abcdefghijklmnop1234567890@group.calendar.google.com``

   Select and copy the calendar ID. You use this value to configure the Google
   Calendar component in your course.

.. _Add a Google Calendar in the Course Body:

========================================
Add a Google Calendar in the Course Body
========================================

To add a Google calendar in the course body, you create an advanced component
in Studio or create a Google Calendar XBlock in OLX.

.. _Add a Google Calendar Component in edX Studio:

Add a Google Calendar Component in edX Studio
**********************************************

Make sure that you :ref:`enable Google Calendars<Enable the Google Calendars
Tool>` for your course before you add a Google Calendar component.

To add a Google Calendar component, follow these steps.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, open the unit where you want to add the
   Google Calendar component.

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **Advanced**, and then select **Google
   Calendar**.

   The new component is added to the unit, with the default edX Google Calendar
   embedded.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-calendar-studio.png
    :width: 600
    :alt: The Google Calendar component in a unit page.

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/google-calendar-edit.png
    :width: 600
    :alt: The Google Calendar editor.

#. In the **Display Name** field, type the name for the component.

#. In the **Public Calendar ID** field, paste the calendar ID you copied in the
   :ref:`Obtain the Google Calendar ID` task.

#. For the **Default View** field, select **Month**, **Week**, or **Agenda**.

   This is the initial view that your learners have of the calendar. Each
   learner can change his or her view.

#. Select **Save**.

You can then :ref:`Preview Course Content` to see how the unit with the Google
Calendar will appear to learners.

.. _Add a Google Calendar XBlock in OLX:

Add a Google Calendar XBlock in OLX
**********************************************

To add a Google Calendar XBlock in OLX, create the ``google-calendar`` element.
You can embed this element in the ``vertical`` element, or you can embed this
element in its own file that is referenced within the vertical. For more
information, see :ref:`olx:OLX Course Building Blocks` in the *EdX Open
Learning XML Guide*.

An example follows.

.. code-block:: xml

  <google-calendar url_name="4115e717366045eaae7764b2e1f25e4c"
    calendar_id="abcdefghijklmnop1234567890@group.calendar.google.com"
    default_view="1" display_name="Class Schedule"/>

The value of the ``calendar_id`` attribute is the calendar ID that you copied
in the :ref:`Obtain the Google Calendar ID` task.

.. note::
  The edX Learning Management System sets the height and width values for
  Google Calendars. If you add these attributes, the LMS overrides your
  changes.

**************************
Editing Google Calendars
**************************

When you make changes to a Google Calendar that is embedded in your course,
learners see the updates immediately. You make changes to calendars with the
Google user interface. You do not need to edit the Google Calendar component.
