Multi-select Problem
#####################

.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

The multi-select problem type is a simple problem type that can be added to any
course. At a minimum, multi-select problems include a question or prompt and
several answer options. By adding hints, feedback, or both, you can give
learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

For more information about the simple problem types, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

**********
Overview
**********

In multi-select problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select all
of the options that are correct answers, and none of the options that are
incorrect. The course team must set up each multi-select problem to have at least
one correct answer.

As a best practice, be sure that all of the answer choices are unambiguous, and
avoid trick questions. Multi-select problems with ambiguity can be frustrating to
learners, especially if the problems have a limited number of attempts.

=============================
Example Multi-select Problem
=============================

In the LMS, learners complete a multi-select problem by selecting the answer
options that they believe are correct as well as leaving unselected the answer
options that they believe are incorrect. An example of a completed multi-select
problem follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/CheckboxExample.png
 :alt: An example multi-select problem in the LMS. This problem was incorrectly
    answered because the learner selected only two of the three required answer
    options. An explanation appears below the answer options because the
    learner also selected "Show Answer".

This problem was incorrectly answered because the learner selected only two of
the three required answer options. This example also shows that the learner
selected **Show Answer** to reveal the correct answer and an explanation.

******************************
Adding a Multi-select Problem
******************************

You add multi-select problems in Studio by selecting the **Problem** component.
In the problem editor, select **the Multi-select** option. Fill in the fields
on this screen to create your problem.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_multi_select.png

Creating a multi-select problem is as simple as:

#. Editing the **Display Name**. Click the pen icon to edit.
#. Filling in the **Question** field.
#. Filling in the **Explanation** field. When this is shown to learners is
   based on the selection in the **Show answer** panel on the right.
#. Filling in the **Answer** fields. Select the correct answer(s) by ticking
   off the checkbox(es). Additional answers can be added by clicking the
   **Add answer** button. Answers can be deleted by clicking the trash can
   icon. Feedback can be provided for each answer. More information on feedback
   can be found in the following section.
#. Selecting and filling in any desired settings on the right.

If you have any questions on the specifics of using the simple editor, please check
out :ref:`Simple Editor` and :ref:`Problem Settings`.

.. _Adding Feedback for Multi-select Problems:

==================
Adding Feedback
==================

For an overview of feedback in problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to
a Problem`. For multi-select problems, you can add feedback for each of the answer
options you provide in the problem. You can also identify different
combinations of answer options that learners are likely to select, and add
group feedback for those combinations.

-----------------------------------------
Adding Feedback for Individual Answers
-----------------------------------------

In multi-select problems, you can provide feedback for each answer that a learner
can select, with distinct feedback depending on whether or not the learner
selects that answer. This means that there are several possible types of
feedback.

* The learner selects a correct answer. This type of feedback
  should indicate why the answer is correct.

* The learner does not select a correct answer. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner missed checking this answer and why it is correct.

* The learner selects an incorrect answer. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner incorrectly checked this answer and why it is
  incorrect.

* The learner does not select an incorrect answer. This type of feedback should
  reinforce why the learner correctly left this answer unselected.

You can access the feedback panel shown below by clicking the button to the
right of the answer text.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_multi_feedback_box.png
 :alt: An example of an expanded feedback section for multi-select problems showing 
    the 'is selected' and 'is not selected' feedback fields.
 :width: 600

-----------------------------------------
Adding Group Feedback
-----------------------------------------

You can configure the multi-select problem to provide group feedback.
Group feedback is feedback given for a specific combination of answers. For
example, if you have three possible answers in the problem, you can define
specific feedback for when a learner selects each combination of possible
options.

* A
* B
* C
* A, B
* B, C
* A, C
* A, B, C

For problems with more than three answers, providing specific feedback for each
combination can become difficult. For such problems, you might choose to define
group feedback for more likely combinations of answers or for combinations of
answers that reflect common learner misunderstandings. If you do not define
feedback for a combination that a learner selects, the learner receives
feedback for the individual selections.

Group feedback can be entered in the Group Feedback panel on the right of the
editor. The example below shows feedback for combinations of (A, B), (B, C)
and (A, C) respectively.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/problem_editor_group_feedback_example.png
 :alt: An example of group feedback.
 :width: 200

.. note:: If you configure individual option feedback for every answer, and
  you also provide group feedback, when learners select the exact
  combination of answer choices defined, they only see the compound feedback.
  In this example, learners who select apple (A), pumpkin (B), and tomato (D)
  see the message "An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as they are all
  the fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds." They do not also see
  the individual feedback for selecting A, B, and D, and for leaving C
  unselected.

.. _Use Hints in a Multi-select Problem:

========================================
Adding Hints
========================================

You can add hints to a multi-select problem. For an overview of hints in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. _Editing Multi-select Problems using the Advanced Editor:

**********************************************************
Editing Multi-select Problems using the Advanced Editor
**********************************************************

If the simple editor is not enough to meet your needs, you can switch over to the
advanced editor. In the setting panels on the right of the editor, click 
**Show advanced settings**, then scroll down and click 
**Switch to advanced editor**.

You can use the advanced editor to identify the elements of a multi-select problem
with OLX. For more information, see :ref:`Multi-select Problem XML`. To format equations,
you can use MathJax. For more information, see :ref:`MathJax in Studio`.

You can see the OLX for the example problem from the Overview section below.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <choiceresponse>
      <label>Learning about the benefits of preventative health care can be
      particularly difficult.</label>
      <description>Check all of the options below that might be reasons why.</description>
      <checkboxgroup>
        <choice correct="true">A large amount of time passes between
         undertaking a preventative measure and seeing the result.</choice>
        <choice correct="false">Non-immunized people will always fall sick.</choice>
        <choice correct="true">If others are immunized, fewer people will fall
         sick regardless of a particular individual's choice to get immunized
         or not.</choice>
        <choice correct="true">Trust in health care professionals and
         government officials is fragile.</choice>
      </checkboxgroup>
      <solution>
        <div class="detailed-solution">
          <p>Explanation</p>
          <p>People who are not immunized against a disease might still not
           fall sick from the disease. If someone is trying to learn whether
           or not preventative measures against the disease have any impact,
           he or she might see these people and conclude, since they have
           remained healthy despite not being immunized, that immunizations
           have no effect. Consequently, he or she would tend to believe that
           immunization (or other preventative measures) have fewer benefits
           than they actually do.</p>
        </div>
      </solution>
    </choiceresponse>
  </problem>

.. note:: You can begin work on the problem in the simple editor, and then
  switch to the advanced editor. However, after you save any advanced OLX
  changes you make in the advanced editor, you may not be able to cannot
  switch back to the simple editor.

=============================
Adding Feedback
=============================

There are several types of feedback you can add for a multi-select problem
and different ways to configure them:

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

----------------------------------------
Adding Feedback for Individual Answers
----------------------------------------

In the advanced editor, you configure feedback with the following syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choice correct="true">Choice label
    <choicehint selected="true">Feedback for when learner selects this
      answer.</choicehint>
    <choicehint selected="false">Feedback for when learner does not select
      this answer.</choicehint>
  </choice>

For example, the following problem has feedback for each answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <multiplechoiceresponse>
      <label>Which of the following is an example of a vegetable?</label>
      <description>You can select only one option.</description>
      <choicegroup type="MultipleChoice">
        <choice correct="false">apple
          <choicehint>An apple is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple
          tree and contains seeds classifying it as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false">pumpkin
          <choicehint>A pumpkin is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant
          and contains seeds classifying it as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="true">potato
          <choicehint>A potato is an edible part of a plant in tuber form and
          is classified as a vegetable.</choicehint>
        </choice>
        <choice correct="false">tomato
          <choicehint>Many people mistakenly think a tomato is a vegetable.
          However, because a tomato is the fertilized ovary of a tomato plant
          and contains seeds it is classified as a fruit.</choicehint>
        </choice>
      </choicegroup>
    </multiplechoiceresponse>
  </problem>

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Subsection_customizing_feedback_labels.rst

------------------------
Adding Group Feedback
------------------------

In the advanced editor, you define group feedback by adding a ``<compoundhint>``
element within the ``<checkboxgroup>`` element.

.. code-block:: xml

          .
          .
          .
        </choice>
        <compoundhint value="Answer Combination">Feedback when learner selects
         this combination of answers.</compoundhint>
      </checkboxgroup>

For example, the following group feedback is used when learners select
options **A, B, and D** or **A, B, C, and D**.

.. code-block:: xml

          .
          .
          .
        </choice>
        <compoundhint value="A B D">An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all
         fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain
         seeds.</compoundhint>
        <compoundhint value="A B C D">You are correct that an apple, pumpkin,
         and tomato are all fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a
         plant and contain seeds. However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an
         edible part of a plant in tuber form and is classified as a vegetable.
        </compoundhint>
      </checkboxgroup>

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Multi-select Problem:

=============================
Awarding Partial Credit
=============================

You can configure a multi-select problem to award partial credit to learners
who submit an answer that is partly correct.

For an overview of partial credit in problems, see :ref:`Awarding Partial
Credit for a Problem`.

.. only:: Partners

 .. note::
    Support for partial credit problems in courses on edx.org and edX
    Edge is provisional. Ensure that you test such problems thoroughly before
    releasing them to learners. For more information, contact your edX partner
    manager.

In the following example, the learner selected two of the three correct
choices, and did not select any incorrect choices. The learner therefore had
four out of five correct answers. Because the course team set this problem up
to award partial credit for every correct answer selected and every incorrect
answer left unselected (known as `every decision counts`_), the learner earned
80% of the points for this problem.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/checkbox_partial_credit.png
 :alt: A checkbox choice problem with partial credit for two out of
     three answers.
 :width: 600

You can use the following methods to award partial credit in a multi-select
problem.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. _Every Decision Counts:

--------------------------------------
Using the Every Decision Counts Method
--------------------------------------

You can configure a multi-select problem so that every selection a learner makes for
the multi-select problem is evaluated and scored. This method is known as every
decision counts (EDC).

With EDC, if "n" is the number of possible answers, learners earn 1/n of the
total possible score for each correct answer they select. Learners receive
partial credit for every correct answer selected and every incorrect answer left
unselected.

For example, if there are four answers, every answer that a learner matches is
worth 25% of the total score. A learner also gains 25% for each incorrect answer
that a learner does NOT select.

The following table shows how the different combinations of learner selections
would score for one EDC problem whose answers are as follows.

* Correct answers: A, B, D
* Incorrect answers: C

.. list-table::
     :widths: 20 20 20
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Learner's Selections
       - Score
       - Explanation
     * - A, B, D
       - 100%
       - The learner matched each of the 3 correct answers for 75%, and also
         gained 25% for not selecting the incorrect answer.
     * - A, B
       - 75%
       - The learner matched 2 of the correct answers for 50%, and also gained
         25% for not selecting the incorrect answer.
     * - A, B, C
       - 50%
       - The learner matched 2 of the correct answers for 50%, but selected the
         incorrect answer.
     * - A, C
       - 25%
       - The learner matched 1 of the correct answers for 25%, but selected the
         incorrect answer.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configure an EDC Multi-select Problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure an EDC multi-select problem, you add the ``partial_credit="EDC"``
attribute to the ``<choiceresponse>`` element in the problem OLX.

For example, the following OLX shows the multi-select problem template after it is
updated to provide partial credit.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <choiceresponse partial_credit="EDC">
      <label>Which of the following is a fruit?</label>
      <description>Select all that apply.</description>
      <checkboxgroup>
        <choice correct="true">apple</choice>
        <choice correct="true">pumpkin</choice>
        <choice correct="false">potato</choice>
        <choice correct="true">tomato</choice>
      </checkboxgroup>
    </choiceresponse>
  </problem>

--------------------------------------
Using the By Halves Method
--------------------------------------

You can configure a multi-select problem so that for every answer that a learner
gets wrong, either by not selecting a correct answer or by selecting an
incorrect answer, half of the remaining points are deducted from the learner's
score. This method is known as scoring by halves.

.. note:: By design, partial credit by halves requires the number of answer
   options to be more than twice the number of incorrect answers. In addition,
   partial credit is not given for more than two wrong answers, regardless of
   the total number of answer options. In other words, two wrong answers is
   scored at 25% only if there are at least 5 answer options. Three or more
   wrong answers is always scored at 0%, regardless of the number of total
   answer options.

Partial credit using the by halves method is calculated as follows.

* If a learner makes no errors, she receives full credit for the problem.

* If a learner makes one error, she receives 50% of the possible points, as
  long as there are three or more choices in the problem. If a learner makes
  one error and there are only two choices in the problem, no credit is given.

* If a learner makes two errors, she receives 25% of the possible points, as
  long as there are five or more choices in the problem. If a learner makes two
  errors and there are only three choices or four choices in the problem, no
  credit is given.

* If a learner makes three errors, she receives no credit for the problem,
  regardless of how many answer options there are.

The following tables illustrate partial credit score using the halves method,
for problems with an increasing number of total answer options.

.. _Using the Script Element in Multi-select Problems:

========================
Using the Script Element
========================

You can use the ``<script>`` element to programmatically set attributes and
options for your multi-select problems.  You could use this feature to display
different questions/answers depending on variable factors, like time of day, or
randomly generated numbers.

-------------------------------------------------------
Use the Advanced Editor to Configure the Script Element
-------------------------------------------------------

You must use the :ref:`advanced editor<Advanced Editor>` to configure a
``<script>`` element.

The contents of the ``<script>`` element must be enclosed in ``<![CDATA[`` ...
``]]>`` markers, to indicate that the enclosed code should not be interpreted
as XML.

The code in the ``<script>`` element is run on the server before the problem is
shown to learners.  Note that only Python script types are supported.

The following OLX example uses random numbers to generate different answer
choices for each learner, and mathematical operators to determine each choice's
correctness.

.. code-block:: xml

    <problem>
      <script type="text/python">
      <![CDATA[
      random.seed(anonymous_student_id)  # Use different random numbers for each student.
      a = random.randint(1,10)
      b = random.randint(1,10)
      c = a + b

      ok0 = c % 2 == 0 # check remainder modulo 2
      text0 = "$a + $b is divisible by 2"

      ok1 = c % 3 == 0 # check remainder modulo 3
      text1 = "$a + $b is divisible by 3"

      ok2 = c % 5 == 0 # check remainder modulo 5
      text2 = "$a + $b is divisible by 5"

      ok3 = not any([ok0, ok1, ok2])
      text3 = "None of the above statements is true."
      ]]>
      </script>
      <choiceresponse>
        <label>Which statements about the number $a+$b are true? Select all that apply.</label>
        <checkboxgroup direction="vertical">
          <choice correct="$ok0">$text0 ... (should be $ok0)</choice>
          <choice correct="$ok1">$text1 ... (should be $ok1)</choice>
          <choice correct="$ok2">$text2 ... (should be $ok2)</choice>
          <choice correct="$ok3">$text3 ... (should be $ok3)</choice>
        </checkboxgroup>
      </choiceresponse>
    </problem>

.. note:: After saving a block with scripts, you'll see an error on the block in your
  unit if your script cannot be executed. One common error is the indentation error.
  The script must start on no indentation regardless of the indentation of the previous
  line.
