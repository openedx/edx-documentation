sure to review the content to ensure that it is accessible to people with
disabilities. For more information, see :ref:`Accessibility Best Practices for

Overview
*********

You use the Oppia exploration tool in Studio to add interactive tutoring
activities, created as Oppia explorations, to your course. Oppia explorations
simulate conversations with human tutors to encourage exploration and
experiential learning.

.. note:: Oppia explorations are not assessments that can be graded. At this
 time, you should not add Oppia exploration components to the graded
 subsections of your course.

The following example shows an Oppia exploration as learners see it in the edX
LMS.

Documentation`_.

Before you can add an Oppia exploration to your course, you must enable this
tool in Studio.

To enable the Oppia exploration tool in Studio, you add the ``"oppia"`` key to

Add an Oppia Exploration in Studio
***********************************

You must :ref:`enable the Oppia exploration tool <Enable the Oppia Exploration
Tool>` before you add a component with an exploration to your course. You must
also select the Oppia exploration that you want to add, and obtain both the URL
of the website that hosts that exploration and its ID.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, open the unit in an ungraded subsection
   where you want to add the exploration.

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **Advanced**, and then select **Oppia
   Exploration**. The new component is added to the unit.

#. In the new component, select **Edit**.

#. In the **Component Display Name** field, enter an identifying name for the
   component. In the LMS, this name appears as a heading above the exploration.

#. In the **Oppia Exploration ID** field, enter the identifier assigned to the
   exploration you want to add. For example, ``qG6kclSxlWZn`` or
   ``gC4_ggkWar-L``.

#. In the **Oppia Server URL** field, enter the host site of the exploration
   you want to add. For example, ``www.oppia.org``.

#. Select **Save**.

   Studio does not show the exploration on the unit page. To verify your work,
   select **Preview**, or publish the unit and then select **View Live**.
