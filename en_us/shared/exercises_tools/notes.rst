.. note:: The notes tool is available for text, including text in
 HTML components. However, the tool is currently not available for discussions,
 exercises, video transcripts, or PDF documents.

Learners can access their notes either in the body of the course or on a
**Notes** page. On the **Notes** page, a learner can see all the notes that
she has made during the course. The page also contains links to the location
of the notes in the course body.
