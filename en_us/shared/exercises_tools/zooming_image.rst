Zooming Image Tool
##################

.. note:: EdX does not support this tool.

You can present information to your learners with an image. If your image is
very large or very detailed, learners might not be able to see all the
information in the image. You can use the zooming image tool to enlarge areas
of your image as the learner moves their cursor over the image.

***********************************
Components of a Zooming Image Tool
***********************************

To create a zooming image tool, you need the following files.

* The image that you want learners to see when they access the unit.

* The image that appears in the magnified area when a learner selects the
  regular image. This image can be larger than the regular image.

* The ``image-zoom-tool.js`` JavaScript file from ``http://files.edx.org
  /image-zoom-tool.js``.

.. note:: Earlier versions of the zooming image tool used a different
   JavaScript file (``jquery.loupeAndLightbox.js``). Exercises that use this
   JavaScript file continue to work, but additional features such as keyboard
   navigation, are not available. EdX recommends that you download and use
   ``image-zoom-tool.js`` file with your zooming image tool, so that the
   zooming feature is available to learners who use keyboard controls instead
   of a mouse.

Create a Zooming Image Tool
****************************

#. Download the ``image-zoom-tool.js`` file by right-clicking the following
   link, then selecting **Save Link As**.

   ``http://files.edx.org/image-zoom-tool.js``

#. In Studio, upload your regular-sized image file, your small image file, and
   the ``image-zoom-tool.js`` file to the **Files & Uploads** page by
   selecting **Content** then selecting **Files & Uploads**.. For more
   information about how to do this, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.

#. Add a zooming image tool to your course. In the course outline in Studio,
   select **Add New Component**, select **HTML**, and then select **Zooming
   Image Tool**.

#. In the new component that appears, select **Edit**.

#. In the component editor, replace the default problem text with your own
   text.

#. Select **HTML** from the toolbar to edit the HTML source code.

#. Scroll down in the file, and then replace the following placeholders with
   your own content.

   - Replace the following file name and path with the name and path of the
     image that you want to appear magnified when the user hovers over the
     regular image.

     ``https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/pathways_detail_01.png``

     For example, your file name and path might be ``/static/Image1.jpg``.

   - Replace the following file name and path with the name and path of the
     image that you want to appear when the page opens.

    ``https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/pathways_overview_01.png``

     For example, your file name and path might be ``/static/Image2.jpg``.

   - Replace the following name and file path with the name and path of the
     JavaScript file that you downloaded from ``files.edx.org``.

     ``https://studio.edx.org/c4x/edX/DemoX/asset/image-zoom-tool.js``

     Because you uploaded the ``image-zoom-tool.js`` file to the
     **Files & Uploads** page, your file name and path is
     ``/static/image-zoom-tool.js``.

   - (Optional) If you want the magnified area to be larger or smaller, change
     the ``width`` and ``height`` values from 350 to larger or smaller numbers.
     For example, you can change both numbers to 450. Or, if you want a
     horizontal oval instead of a circle, you can change the ``width`` value to
     a number such as 500 and the ``height`` value to a number such as 150.

   The HTML in your zooming image tool might resemble the following.
