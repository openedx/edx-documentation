A Brief Introduction to MathJax in Studio
############################################

To write clear and professional-looking symbols and equations, edX uses a
LaTeX-like language called
`MathJax <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathjax.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGef2H-mZCdmCo7-kWHfu9fUGVCfg>`_.
Your MathJax equations can appear with other text in the paragraph (inline
equations) or on their own lines (display equations).

- For inline equations, you can do either of the following.

  - Surround your Mathjax expression with backslashes and **parentheses**.

    ``\( equation \)``

  - Surround your Mathjax expression with [mathjaxinline] tags. Note that these
    tags use square brackets ([]).

    [mathjaxinline] equation [/mathjaxinline]

- For display equations, you can do either of the following.

  - Surround your Mathjax expression with backslashes and **brackets**.

    ``\[ equation \]``

  - Surround your Mathjax expression with [mathjax] tags. Note that these tags
    use square brackets ([]).

    [mathjax] equation [/mathjax]

You can use MathJax in HTML (text) components and in problem components.

.. note:: Complete MathJax documentation (together with a testing tool) can be
          found at `http://www.onemathematicalcat.org/MathJaxDocumentation/TeXSyntax.htm <http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onemathematicalcat.org%2FMathJaxDocumentation%2FTeXSyntax.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEV8PtCX6Csp0lW7lDKOLIKCOCkHg>`_.

****************************
HTML (Text) Components
****************************

In the HTML component editor, you can use MathJax both in Visual view and in HTML view.

Problem Components
*********************

In the problem component editor, you can use MathJax both in the Simple Editor
and in the Advanced Editor.

In the example problem below, note that the Einstein equation in the
explanation is enclosed in backslashes and parentheses, so it appears inline
with the text. The Navier-Stokes equation is enclosed in backslashes and
brackets, so it appears on its own line.
