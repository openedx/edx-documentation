Overview
**********

In checkbox problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select all of
the options that are correct answers, and none of the options that are
incorrect. The course team must set up each checkbox problem to have at least
one correct answer.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/CheckboxExample.png
 :alt: A checkbox problem with four options, 2 of which are correct.

.. note:: 
   Make sure that all of the answer choices are unambiguous, and avoid trick
   questions. Checkbox problems with ambiguity can be frustrating to learners,
   especially if they have a limited number of attempts.

Analyzing Performance on Checkbox Problems
**************************************************

For the checkbox problems in your course, you can use edX Insights to review
aggregated learner performance data and examine submitted answers. For more
information, see `Using edX Insights`_.


****************************
Creating a Checkbox Problem
****************************

You can create checkbox problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced
Editor. You can set up a problem in the Simple Editor, and then switch to the
Advanced Editor to add more configuration options in XML. However, you cannot
switch back to the Simple Editor from the Advanced Editor. Therefore, you
might want to format the problem as completely as possible before you begin to
use the Advanced Editor.

.. _Use the Simple Editor to Create a Checkbox Problem:

======================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Create a Checkbox Problem
======================================================

To use the :ref:`Simple Editor<Simple Editor>` to create a checkbox problem,
follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.
#. Select one of the two checkbox problem templates.
   
   * From the list of **Common Problem Types**, select **Checkboxes**. 
   
   * From the list of **Common Problems with Hints and Feedback**, select
     **Checkboxes with Hints and Feedback**. For more information, see `Use
     Feedback in a Checkbox Problem`_.

   Studio adds the checkbox problem to the unit.

#. Select **Edit**. The Simple Editor opens. 
#. Replace the sample problem text with your own text.
#. Determine the text that describes the question you want learners to answer,
   and surround that text with two pairs of angle brackets (``>>question<<``).
   This question text is the accessible label for the problem.
#. Edit the text to place each answer option on a separate line.
#. Select the set of answer options, and then select **Checkboxes** from the
   toolbar. A pair of brackets appears next to each answer choice.
#. To identify each correct answer, add an **x** between the brackets for that
   option.
#. To provide an explanation, select the explanation text and then select 
   **Explanation** from the toolbar. ``[explanation]`` appears before
   and after the explanation text.
#. Select **Settings** and provide an identifying **Display Name** for the
   problem.
#. Define additional settings for the problem. For more information, see
   :ref:`Problem Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

For the example problem illustrated above, the following text displays in the
problem component.

::

    Learning about the benefits of preventative healthcare can be particularly 
    difficult. >>Check all of the reasons below why this may be the case.<<

    [x] A large amount of time passes between undertaking a preventative measure and seeing the result. 
    [ ] Non-immunized people will always fall sick. 
    [x] If others are immunized, fewer people will fall sick regardless of a particular individual's choice to get immunized or not. 
    [x] Trust in healthcare professionals and government officials is fragile. 

.. please do not line wrap this text.

    [explanation]
    People who are not immunized against a disease may still not fall sick from the disease. If someone is trying to learn whether or not preventative measures against the disease have any impact, he or she may see these people and conclude, since they have remained healthy despite not being immunized, that immunizations have no effect. Consequently, he or she would tend to believe that immunization (or other preventative measures) have fewer benefits than they actually do.

.. _Use Feedback in a Checkbox Problem:

********************************************
Using Feedback in a Checkbox Problem
********************************************

You can add feedback in a checkbox problem using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of feedback in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

In checkbox problems, you can provide feedback for each option that a learner
can select, with distinct feedback depending on whether or not the learner
selects that option. This means that there are four possible types of feedback.

* The learner selects a correct option. This type of feedback
  should indicate why the option is correct.

* The learner does not select a correct option. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner missed checking this option and why it is correct.

* The learner selects an incorrect option. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner incorrectly checked this option and why it is
  incorrect

* The learner does not select an incorrect option. This type of feedback should
  reinforce why the learner correctly left this option unselected.

=============================
Compound Feedback
=============================

You can configure the checkbox problem to provide compound feedback.
Compound feedback is feedback given for a specific combination of options. For
example, if you have three possible option in the problem, you can define
specific feedback for when a learner selects each combination of possible
options.

* A
* B
* C
* A, B
* B, C
* A, C
* A, B, C
  
For problems with more than three options, providing specific feedback for each
combination can become difficult. For such problems, you can define compound
feedback for more likely combinations of option or for combinations of option
that reflect common learner misunderstandings. If you do not define feedback
for a combination that a learner selects, the learner receives feedback for the
individual selections.

=======================================
Configure Feedback in the Simple Editor
=======================================

You can configure individual option and compound feedback in the :ref:`Simple
Editor<Simple Editor>`. When you create a new checkbox problem, select the
template **Checkboxes with Hints and Feedback**. This template has example
feedback syntax that you can replace.

Configure Feedback for Individual Options
******************************************

In the simple editor, you configure individual option feedback with the
following syntax.

::

  [x] answer  {{ selected: Feedback when learner selects this option. }, 
  {unselected: Feedback when the learner does not select this option.}}

.. note:: You can use ``S`` for ``selected`` and ``U`` for unselected.

For example, the following problem has feedback for each option.

::

  >>Which of the following is an example of a fruit? Check all that apply.<<

  [x] apple  {{ selected: You are correct that an apple is a fruit because it
  is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple tree and contains seeds. },
  { unselected: Remember that an apple is also a fruit.}}

  [x] pumpkin {{ selected: You are correct that a pumpkin is a fruit because it
  is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant and contains seeds.}, { unselected:
  Remember that a pumpkin is also a fruit.}}

  [ ] potato   {{ U: You are correct that a potato is a vegetable because it is
  an edible part of a plant in tuber form.}, { S: A potato is a vegetable, not
  a fruit, because it does not come from the flower on a plant or tree and does
  not contain seeds.}}

  [x] tomato  {{ S: You are correct that a tomato is a fruit because it is the
  fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds. }, { U: Many people
  mistakenly think a tomato is a vegetable. However, because a tomato is the
  fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds it is classified as a
  fruit.}}


Configure Compound Feedback
****************************

In the simple editor, you configure compound feedback after the possible
options, with the following syntax.

::

  {{ ((Answer Combination)) Feedback when learner selects this combination of
  options.}}

For example, the following compound feedback is used when learners select
options **A, B, and D** or **A, B, C, and D**.

::

  {{ ((A B D)) An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as they are all the
  fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds. }} 

  {{ ((A B C D)) You are correct that an apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all
  fruits as they are all the fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds.
  However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an edible part of a plant in tuber
  form and is classified as a vegetable.  }}

=========================================
Configure Feedback in the Advanced Editor
=========================================

You can configure individual option and compound feedback in the :ref:`Advanced
Editor<Advanced Editor>`.

Configure Individual Option Feedback
*************************************

In the advanced editor, you configure individual option feedback with the
following syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

    <choice correct="true">Choice label
      <choicehint selected="true">
        Feedback for when learner selects this answer.
      </choicehint>
      <choicehint selected="false">
        Feedback for when learner does not select this answer.
      </choicehint>
    </choice>

For example, the following problem has feedback for each option.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choiceresponse> 
    <checkboxgroup label="Which of the following is an example
    of a fruit? Check all that apply." direction="vertical">
      <choice correct="true">apple
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that an apple is a fruit 
          because it is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple tree and 
          contains seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Remember that an apple is also a 
          fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">pumpkin
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that a pumpkin is a fruit 
          because it is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant and contains 
          seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Remember that a pumpkin is also a 
          fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="false">potato
        <choicehint selected="true">A potato is a vegetable, not a fruit, 
          because it does not come from the flower on a plant or tree and does 
          not contain seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">You are correct that a potato is 
          classified as a vegetable because it is an edible part of a plant in 
          tuber form.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">tomato
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that a tomato is 
          classified as a fruit because it is the fertilized ovary of a tomato 
          plant and contains seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Many people mistakenly think a tomato is 
          a vegetable. However, because a tomato is the fertilized ovary of a 
          tomato plant and contains seeds it is classified as a fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
    </checkboxgroup>
  </choiceresponse>

Configure Compound Feedback
***************************

In the advanced editor, you define compound feedback in the ``<compoundhint>``
element within the ``<checkboxgroup>`` element.

.. code-block:: xml

  <compoundhint value="Answer Combination">
    Feedback when learner selects this combination of answers.
  </compoundhint>}}

For example, the following compound feedback is used when learners select
options **A, B, and D** or **A, B, C, and D**.

.. code-block:: xml

  <compoundhint value="A B D">An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as 
    they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds.
  </compoundhint>
  <compoundhint value="A B C D">You are correct that an apple, pumpkin, and 
    tomato are all fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and 
    contain seeds. However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an edible part of 
    a plant in tuber form and is classified as a vegetable.
  </compoundhint>

.. _Use Hints in a Checkbox Problem:

********************************************
Using Hints in a Checkbox Problem
********************************************

You can add hints to a checkbox problem, using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of hints in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Subsection_configure_hints.rst

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Checkbox Problem:

*********************************************
Awarding Partial Credit in a Checkbox Problem
*********************************************

You can configure a checkbox problem to award partial credit to learners
who submit an answer that is partly correct. You must use the `Advanced Editor
<Use the Advanced Editor to Edit a Checkbox Problem>`_ to configure partial
credit.

In the following example, the learner selected two of the three correct
choices, and did not select any incorrect choices. The learner therefore had 4
out of 5 correct answers. As this is an :ref:`EDC problem <Every Decision
Counts>`, the learner earned 80%.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/checkbox_partial_credit.png
 :alt: Image of a checkbox choice problem with partial credit for two out of
     three answers.
 :width: 600

For an overview of partial credit in problems, see
:ref:`Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem`.

There are two ways to award partial credit in a checkbox problem.

.. _Every Decision Counts:

======================================
Using the Every Decision Counts Style
======================================

You can configure a checkbox problem so that the learner's response for every
option is evaluated and scored. This is referred to as EDC, every decision
counts.

With EDC, for each option the learner gets wrong, either by not selecting a
correct option or selecting an incorrect option, the learner's score is
reduced by 1/n, where "n" is the number of options.

For example, if there are four options, each one is worth 25% of the total
score. If a learner's response is wrong for one option, she receives 75% of the
points for the problem.

To expand on this example, take a checkbox problem with four options, A, B, C,
and D. Options A and B are correct, and C and D are incorrect. The following
table describes the learner's score for different submissions for an EDC
problem.

.. list-table::
     :widths: 20 20 20 20
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Learner's Selections
       - Correct Answers
       - Incorrect Answers
       - Score
     * - A, B, C
       - A, B, D
       - C
       - 75%
     * - A
       - A, C, D
       - B
       - 75%
     * - A, C
       - A, D
       - B, C
       - 50%
     * - C, D
       - 
       - A, B, C, D
       - 0%

Configure an EDC Checkbox Problem
**********************************

To configure an EDC checkbox problem, you add the
attribute ``partial_credit="EDC"`` to the ``<choiceresponse>`` element in the
problem XML. 

For example, the following XML shows the checkbox problem template after it is
updated to provide partial credit.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choiceresponse partial_credit="EDC">
    <checkboxgroup label="Which of the following is a fruit? Check all that apply.">
      <choice correct="true">apple</choice>
      <choice correct="true">pumpkin</choice>
      <choice correct="false">potato</choice>
      <choice correct="true">tomato</choice>
    </checkboxgroup>
  </choiceresponse>

=======================
Using the Halves Style
=======================

You can configure a checkbox problem so that for every option a learner gets
wrong, either by not selecting a correct option or selecting an incorrect
option, half of the remaining points are subtracted from the problem. This is
referred to as scoring by "Halves".

For example, if a learner gets one out of four options wrong, he receives 50%
of the points for the problem.

To expand on the example above, in which options A and B are correct, and C and
D are incorrect, the following table describes the learner's score for
different submissions for a Halves problem.

.. list-table::
     :widths: 20 20 20 20
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Learner's Selections
       - Correct Answers
       - Incorrect Answers
       - Score
     * - A, B, C
       - A, B, D
       - C
       - 50%
     * - A
       - A, C, D
       - B
       - 50%
     * - A, C
       - A, D
       - B, C
       - 0%
     * - C, D
       - 
       - A, B, C, D
       - 0%

.. note:: 
  For half of the remaining points to be deducted, the problem must have more
  than twice the number of options than the number of incorrect answers in the
  learner's response. Otherwise, the learner receives no credit for the
  problem. For example, if the learner gets two out of four options wrong, he
  receives no credit for the problem. If he gets two out of five options wrong,
  he gets 25% of the points.


Configure a Halves Checkbox Problem
************************************

To configure a Halves checkbox problem, you add the attribute
``partial_credit="halves"`` to the ``<choiceresponse>`` element in the problem
XML.

For example, the following XML shows the checkbox problem template
updated to provide partial credit.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choiceresponse partial_credit="halves">
    <checkboxgroup label="Which of the following is a fruit? Check all that apply.">
      <choice correct="true">apple</choice>
      <choice correct="true">pumpkin</choice>
      <choice correct="false">potato</choice>
      <choice correct="true">tomato</choice>
    </checkboxgroup>
  </choiceresponse>
