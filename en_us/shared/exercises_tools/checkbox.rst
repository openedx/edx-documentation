Overview
**********

In checkbox problems, learners select one or more options from a list of
possible answers. To answer the problem correctly, a learner must select all of
the options that are correct answers, and none of the options that are
incorrect. The course team must set up each checkbox problem to have at least
one correct answer.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/CheckboxExample.png
 :alt: A checkbox problem with four options, two of which are correct.

.. note::
   Make sure that all of the answer choices are unambiguous, and avoid trick
   questions. Checkbox problems with ambiguity can be frustrating to learners,
   especially if the problems have a limited number of attempts.

Analyzing Performance on Checkbox Problems
==========================================

For the checkbox problems in your course, you can use edX Insights to review
aggregated learner performance data and examine submitted answers. For more
information, see :ref:`insights:Using edX Insights`.

**************************************
Creating a Checkbox Problem
**************************************

You can create checkbox problems in the simple editor or in the advanced
editor. You can set up a problem in the simple editor, and then switch to the
advanced editor to change problem configuration using OLX (open learning XML).
However, you cannot switch back to the simple editor from the advanced editor.
Therefore, you might want to format the problem as completely as possible
before you begin to use the advanced editor.


.. _Use the Simple Editor to Create a Checkbox Problem:

======================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Create a Checkbox Problem
======================================================

To use the :ref:`simple editor<Simple Editor>` to create a checkbox problem,
follow these steps.

   :ref:`Problem Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

For the example problem illustrated above, the following text displays in the
problem component.

::

    Learning about the benefits of preventative healthcare can be particularly
    difficult. >>Check all of the reasons below why this may be the case.<<

    [x] A large amount of time passes between undertaking a preventative measure and seeing the result.
    [ ] Non-immunized people will always fall sick.
    [x] If others are immunized, fewer people will fall sick regardless of a particular individual's choice to get immunized or not.
    [x] Trust in healthcare professionals and government officials is fragile.

.. please do not line wrap this text.

    [explanation]
    People who are not immunized against a disease may still not fall sick from the disease. If someone is trying to learn whether or not preventative measures against the disease have any impact, he or she may see these people and conclude, since they have remained healthy despite not being immunized, that immunizations have no effect. Consequently, he or she would tend to believe that immunization (or other preventative measures) have fewer benefits than they actually do.

.. _Use Feedback in a Checkbox Problem:

********************************************
Using Feedback in a Checkbox Problem
********************************************

You can add feedback in a checkbox problem using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of feedback in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

In checkbox problems, you can provide feedback for each option that a learner
can select, with distinct feedback depending on whether or not the learner
selects that option. This means that there are four possible types of feedback.

* The learner selects a correct option. This type of feedback
  should indicate why the option is correct.

* The learner does not select a correct option. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner missed checking this option and why it is correct.

* The learner selects an incorrect option. This type of feedback should
  indicate that the learner incorrectly checked this option and why it is
  incorrect

* The learner does not select an incorrect option. This type of feedback should
  reinforce why the learner correctly left this option unselected.

=============================
Compound Feedback
=============================

You can configure the checkbox problem to provide compound feedback.
Compound feedback is feedback given for a specific combination of options. For
example, if you have three possible option in the problem, you can define
specific feedback for when a learner selects each combination of possible
options.

* A
* B
* C
* A, B
* B, C
* A, C
* A, B, C

For problems with more than three options, providing specific feedback for each
combination can become difficult. For such problems, you can define compound
feedback for more likely combinations of option or for combinations of option
that reflect common learner misunderstandings. If you do not define feedback
for a combination that a learner selects, the learner receives feedback for the
individual selections.

=======================================
Configure Feedback in the Simple Editor
=======================================

You can configure individual option and compound feedback in the :ref:`simple
editor<Simple Editor>`. When you create a new checkbox problem, select the
template **Checkboxes with Hints and Feedback**. This template has example
feedback syntax that you can replace.

Configure Feedback for Individual Options
******************************************

In the simple editor, you configure individual option feedback with the
following syntax.

::

  [x] answer  {{ selected: Feedback when learner selects this option. },
  {unselected: Feedback when the learner does not select this option.}}

.. note:: You can use ``S`` for ``selected`` and ``U`` for unselected.

For example, the following problem has feedback for each option.

::

  >>Which of the following is an example of a fruit? Check all that apply.<<

  [x] apple  {{ selected: You are correct that an apple is a fruit because it
  is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple tree and contains seeds. },
  { unselected: Remember that an apple is also a fruit.}}

  [x] pumpkin {{ selected: You are correct that a pumpkin is a fruit because it
  is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant and contains seeds.}, { unselected:
  Remember that a pumpkin is also a fruit.}}

  [ ] potato   {{ U: You are correct that a potato is a vegetable because it is
  an edible part of a plant in tuber form.}, { S: A potato is a vegetable, not
  a fruit, because it does not come from the flower on a plant or tree and does
  not contain seeds.}}

  [x] tomato  {{ S: You are correct that a tomato is a fruit because it is the
  fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds. }, { U: Many people
  mistakenly think a tomato is a vegetable. However, because a tomato is the
  fertilized ovary of a tomato plant and contains seeds it is classified as a
  fruit.}}


Configure Compound Feedback
****************************

In the simple editor, you configure compound feedback after the possible
options, with the following syntax.

::

  {{ ((Answer Combination)) Feedback when learner selects this combination of
  options.}}

For example, the following compound feedback is used when learners select
options **A, B, and D** or **A, B, C, and D**.

::

  {{ ((A B D)) An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as they are all the
  fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds. }}

  {{ ((A B C D)) You are correct that an apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all
  fruits as they are all the fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds.
  However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an edible part of a plant in tuber
  form and is classified as a vegetable.  }}

=========================================
Configure Feedback in the Advanced Editor
=========================================

You can configure individual option and compound feedback in the :ref:`Advanced
Editor<Advanced Editor>`.

Configure Individual Option Feedback
*************************************

In the advanced editor, you configure individual option feedback with the
following syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

    <choice correct="true">Choice label
      <choicehint selected="true">
        Feedback for when learner selects this answer.
      </choicehint>
      <choicehint selected="false">
        Feedback for when learner does not select this answer.
      </choicehint>
    </choice>

For example, the following problem has feedback for each option.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choiceresponse>
    <checkboxgroup label="Which of the following is an example
    of a fruit? Check all that apply.">
      <choice correct="true">apple
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that an apple is a fruit
          because it is the fertilized ovary that comes from an apple tree and
          contains seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Remember that an apple is also a
          fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">pumpkin
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that a pumpkin is a fruit
          because it is the fertilized ovary of a squash plant and contains
          seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Remember that a pumpkin is also a
          fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="false">potato
        <choicehint selected="true">A potato is a vegetable, not a fruit,
          because it does not come from the flower on a plant or tree and does
          not contain seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">You are correct that a potato is
          classified as a vegetable because it is an edible part of a plant in
          tuber form.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="true">tomato
        <choicehint selected="true">You are correct that a tomato is
          classified as a fruit because it is the fertilized ovary of a tomato
          plant and contains seeds.
        </choicehint>
        <choicehint selected="false">Many people mistakenly think a tomato is
          a vegetable. However, because a tomato is the fertilized ovary of a
          tomato plant and contains seeds it is classified as a fruit.
        </choicehint>
      </choice>
    </checkboxgroup>
  </choiceresponse>

Configure Compound Feedback
***************************

In the advanced editor, you define compound feedback in the ``<compoundhint>``
element within the ``<checkboxgroup>`` element.

.. code-block:: xml

  <compoundhint value="Answer Combination">
    Feedback when learner selects this combination of answers.
  </compoundhint>}}

For example, the following compound feedback is used when learners select
options **A, B, and D** or **A, B, C, and D**.

.. code-block:: xml

  <compoundhint value="A B D">An apple, pumpkin, and tomato are all fruits as
    they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and contain seeds.
  </compoundhint>
  <compoundhint value="A B C D">You are correct that an apple, pumpkin, and
    tomato are all fruits as they all are fertilized ovaries of a plant and
    contain seeds. However, a potato is not a fruit as it is an edible part of
    a plant in tuber form and is classified as a vegetable.
  </compoundhint>

.. _Use Hints in a Checkbox Problem:

********************************************
Using Hints in a Checkbox Problem
********************************************

You can add hints to a checkbox problem, using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of hints in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Subsection_configure_hints.rst

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Checkbox Problem:

*********************************************
Awarding Partial Credit in a Checkbox Problem
*********************************************

You can configure a checkbox problem to award partial credit to learners
who submit an answer that is partly correct. You must use the `advanced editor
<Use the Advanced Editor to Edit a Checkbox Problem>`_ to configure partial
credit.

For an overview of partial credit in problems, see :ref:`Awarding Partial
Credit for a Problem`.

.. only:: Partners

 .. note::
    Support for partial credit problems in courses on edx.org and edX
    Edge is provisional. Ensure that you test such problems thoroughly before
    releasing them to learners. For more information, contact your edX partner
    manager.

In the following example, the learner selected two of the three correct
choices, and did not select any incorrect choices. The learner therefore had
four out of five correct answers. Because the course team set this problem up
to award partial credit for every correct answer selected and every incorrect
answer left unselected (known as `every decision counts`_), the learner earned
80% of the points for this problem.

There are two ways to award partial credit in a checkbox problem.

.. _Every Decision Counts:

======================================
Using the Every Decision Counts Style
======================================

You can configure a checkbox problem so that the learner's response for every
option is evaluated and scored. This is known as "every decision counts"
(EDC).

With EDC, for each option the learner gets wrong, either by not selecting a
correct option or selecting an incorrect option, the learner's score is
reduced by 1/n, where "n" is the number of options.

For example, if there are four options, each one is worth 25% of the total
score. If a learner's response is wrong for one option, she receives 75% of the
points for the problem.

The following table describes the learner's score for different submissions
for EDC problems with a variety of correct answer options.

.. list-table::
     :widths: 20 20 20 20
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Learner's Selections
       - Correct Answers
       - Incorrect Answers
       - Score
     * - A, B, C
       - A, B, D
       - C
       - 75%
     * - A
       - A, C, D
       - B
       - 75%
     * - A, C
       - A, D
       - B, C
       - 50%
     * - C, D
       -
       - A, B, C, D
       - 0%

Configure an EDC Checkbox Problem
**********************************

To configure an EDC checkbox problem, you add the ``partial_credit="EDC"``
attribute to the ``<choiceresponse>`` element in the problem OLX.

For example, the following OLX shows the checkbox problem template after it is
updated to provide partial credit.

.. code-block:: xml

  <choiceresponse partial_credit="EDC">
    <checkboxgroup label="Which of the following is a fruit? Check all that apply.">
      <choice correct="true">apple</choice>
      <choice correct="true">pumpkin</choice>
      <choice correct="false">potato</choice>
      <choice correct="true">tomato</choice>
    </checkboxgroup>
  </choiceresponse>

=======================
Using the Halves Style
=======================

You can configure a checkbox problem so that for every option that a learner
gets wrong, either by not selecting a correct option or by selecting an
incorrect option, half of the remaining points are deducted from the learner's
score. This is known as scoring by "halves".

.. note:: By design, partial credit by halves requires the number of answer
   options to be more than twice the number of incorrect answers. In addition,
   partial credit is not given for more than two wrong answers, regardless of
   the total number of answer options. In other words, two wrong answers is
   scored at 25% only if there are at least 5 answer options. Three or more
   wrong answers is always scored at 0%, regardless of the number of total
   answer options.

Partial credit using the halves method is calculated as follows.

* If a learner makes no errors, she receives full credit for the problem.

* If a learner makes one error, she receives 50% of the possible points, as long
  as there are three or more choices in the problem. If a learner makes one
  error and there are only two choices in the problem, no credit is given.

* If a learner makes two errors, she receives 25% of the possible points, as
  long as there are five or more choices in the problem. If a learner makes two
  errors and there are only three choices or four choices in the problem, no
  credit is given.

* If a learner makes three errors, she receives no credit for the problem,
  regardless of how many answer options there are.

The following tables illustrate partial credit score using the halves method,
for problems with an increasing number of total answer options.
