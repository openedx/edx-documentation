Word Cloud Tool
##################


In a word cloud tool, students enter words into a field in response
to a question or prompt. The words all the students have entered then
appear instantly as a colorful graphic, with the most popular responses
appearing largest. The graphic becomes larger as more students answer.
Students can both see the way their peers have answered and contribute
their thoughts to the group.


For example, the following word cloud was created from students'
responses to a question in a HarvardX course.
