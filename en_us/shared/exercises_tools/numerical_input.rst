Numerical Input Problem
########################

In numerical input problems, learners enter numbers or specific and relatively
simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. The text that the
learners enter is converted to a symbolic expression that appears below the
response field.

 :alt: A numerical input problem with 3 questions, 2 correct answers and 1
     incorrect answer

You can specify a margin of error, or tolerance, for the answers to these
problems so that learners' responses do not have to be exact. You can 
specify a correct answer explicitly or use a Python script.

Responses for numerical input problems can include integers, fractions, and
constants such as pi and g. Responses can also include text representing
common functions, such as square root (sqrt) and log base 2 (log2), as well as
trigonometric functions and their inverses, such as sine (sin) and arcsine
(arcsin). For these functions, learners enter text that is converted into
mathematical symbols. The following example shows a response entered by a
learner and the numerical expression that results.

Response Formatting for Students`_.

***********************************
Creating a Numerical Input Problem 
***********************************

You can create numerical problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced
Editor regardless of the answer to the problem. 

* If the text of your problem does not include any italics, bold formatting,
  or special characters, you can create the problem in the Simple Editor. 
* If the text of your problem contains special formatting or characters, or if
  your problem contains a Python script, you use the Advanced Editor.

For example, the following problems require the Advanced Editor.

For more information about including a Python script in your problem, see
:ref:`Write Your Own Grader`.

.. _Use the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem:

========================================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem
========================================================================

To use the Simple Editor to create a numerical input problem, follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.
#. From the list of **Common Problem Types**, select **Numerical Input**.
#. Select **Edit**. The Simple Editor opens with an example problem. In the
   editor, you replace the sample problem text with your own text.
#. Determine the text that expresses the question you want learners to answer,
   and then use two sets of angle brackets (>><<) to surround that text. This
   question text is the accessible label for the problem.
#. To identify the problem's answer, select the answer text and then select
   **Numerical Input** in the editing toolbar. An equals sign appears
   next to the answer.
#. Optionally, specify a margin of error, or tolerance. You can specify a
   percentage, number, or range.

   * To specify a percentage on either side of the correct answer, after the
     answer add **+-{number}%**. For example, to include a 2% tolerance, add
     **+-2%**.

   * To specify a number on either side of the correct answer, after the
     answer add **+-{number}**. For example, to include a tolerance of 5, add
     **+-5**.

   * To specify a range, you provide the starting and ending values separated
     by a comma and then surround the rangge with brackets [] or parentheses
     (). A bracket includes the number next to it in the range, and a
     parenthesis excludes the number from the range. For example, if you specify
     **[5, 8)**, correct answers can be 5, 6, and 7, but not 8. Likewise, if
     you specify **(5, 8]**, correct answers can be 6, 7, and 8, but not 5.

8. To provide an explanation, select the explanation text and then select the
   **Explanation** from the toolbar. "[explanation]" appears before
   and after the explanation text.
#. Select **Settings** and provide an identifying **Display Name** for the
   problem.
#. Specify options for the problem. For more information, see :ref:`Problem
   Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

For the first example problem above, the text in the problem component appears
as follows.

::

   >>What base is the decimal numeral system in?<<

   = 10
    
   [explanation]
   The decimal numeral system is base ten.
   [explanation]

========================================================================
Use the Advanced Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem 
========================================================================

For a more complex problem, such as the one that follows, you use the Advanced Editor.

#. Follow steps 1-3 for creating the problem in the :ref:`Simple Editor<Use
   the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem>`. 
#. Select **Advanced Editor**, and then replace the existing code with the
   following code.

**Problem Code**:

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <p><b>Example Problem</b></p>

  <p>What base is the decimal numeral system in?
      <numericalresponse answer="10">
          <formulaequationinput label="What base is the decimal numeral system in?"/>
      </numericalresponse>
  </p>

    <p>What is the value of the standard gravity constant <i>g</i>, measured in m/s<sup>2</sup>? Give your answer to at least two decimal places.
    <numericalresponse answer="9.80665">
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.01" />
      <formulaequationinput label="Give your answer to at least two decimal places"/>
    </numericalresponse>
  </p>

  <!-- The following uses Python script spacing. Make sure it is not indented when you add it to the problem component. -->
  <script type="loncapa/python">
  computed_response = math.sqrt(math.fsum([math.pow(math.pi,2), math.pow(math.e,2)]))
  </script>

  <p>What is the distance in the plane between the points (pi, 0) and (0, e)? You can type math.
      <numericalresponse answer="$computed_response">
          <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.0001" />
          <formulaequationinput label="What is the distance in the plane between the points (pi, 0) and (0, e)?"/>
      </numericalresponse>
  </p>
  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The decimal numerical system is base ten.</p>
      <p>The standard gravity constant is defined to be precisely 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
      This is 9.80 to two decimal places. Entering 9.8 also works.</p>
      <p>By the distance formula, the distance between two points in the plane is
         the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences of each coordinate.
        Even though an exact numerical value is checked in this case, the
        easiest way to enter this answer is to type
        <code>sqrt(pi^2+e^2)</code> into the editor.
        Other answers like <code>sqrt((pi-0)^2+(0-e)^2)</code> also work.

* ``<numericalresponse>`` (required): Specifies that the problem is a
  numerical input problem.
* ``<formulaequationinput />`` (required): Provides a response field where the
  learner enters a response.
* ``<responseparam>`` (optional): Specifies a tolerance, or margin of error,
  for an answer.
* ``<script>`` (optional)

.. note:: Some older problems use the ``<textline math="1" />`` tag instead 
 of the ``<formulaequationinput />`` tag. However, the ``<textline math="1"
 />`` tag has been deprecated. All new problems should use the
 ``<formulaequationinput />`` tag.

**Tag:** ``<numericalresponse>``

Specifies that the problem is a numerical input problem. The
``<numericalresponse>`` tag is similar to the ``<formularesponse>`` tag, but
the ``<numericalresponse>`` tag does not allow unspecified variables.

  Attributes

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Attribute
       - Description
     * - answer (required)
       - The correct answer to the problem, given as a mathematical
         expression.

  .. note:: If you include a variable name preceded with a dollar sign 
   ($) in the problem, you can include a script in the problem that computes
   the expression in terms of that variable.

  The grader evaluates the answer that you provide and the learner's response
  in the same way. The grader also automatically simplifies any numeric
  expressions that you or a learner provides. Answers can include simple
  expressions such as "0.3" and "42", or more complex expressions such as
  "1/3" and "sin(pi/5)".

  Children
  
  * ``<responseparam>``
  * ``<formulaequationinput>``

**Tag:** ``<formulaequationinput>``

Creates a response field in the LMS where students enter a response.
