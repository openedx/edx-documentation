.. note:: EdX offers full support for this problem type.

The numerical input problem type is a core problem type that can be added to
any course. At a minimum, numerical input problems include a question or
prompt and a response field for a numeric answer. By adding hints, feedback, or
both, you can give learners guidance and help when they work on a problem.

For more information about the core problem types, see
:ref:`Working with Problem Components`.

**********
Overview
**********

In numerical input problems, learners enter numbers or specific and relatively
simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. The LMS automatically
converts the answer that learners enter into a symbolic expression that appears
below the response field.

Responses for numerical input problems can include integers, fractions, and
constants such as pi and *g*. Responses can also include text representing
common functions, such as square root (sqrt) and log base 2 (log2), as well as
trigonometric functions and their inverses, such as sine (sin) and arcsine
(arcsin). For these functions, learners enter text that is converted into
mathematical symbols. The following example shows a response entered by a
learner and the numerical expression that results.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Math5.png
 :alt: A learner typed n*x^(n-1) to enter the symbolic expression n times x to
     the n minus 1 power.

For more information about how learners enter expressions, see
:ref:`learners:Math Formatting` in the *EdX Learner's Guide* or
:ref:`openlearners:Math Formatting` in the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

Some of the options for numerical input problems include the following.

* You can specify a correct answer explicitly or use a Python script.

* You can specify a margin of error, or tolerance, for the answers to numerical
  input problems so that learners' responses do not have to be exact.

.. note::
  You can make a calculator tool available to your learners on every unit
  page. For more information, see :ref:`Calculator`.

================================
Example Numerical Input Problem
================================

In the LMS, learners enter a value into a response field to complete a
numerical input problem. An example of a completed numerical input problem  follows.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/NumericalInputExample.png
 :alt: A problem with one question, answered correctly, in the LMS.

To add the example problem illustrated above, in Studio you use the simple
editor to enter the following text and Markdown formatting.

::

   >>In what base is the decimal numeral system?<<

   =10 {{The decimal numeral system is in base ten.}}


The open learning XML (OLX) markup for this example numerical input problem
follows.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="10">
      <label>In what base is the decimal numeral system?</label>
      <formulaequationinput/>
      <solution>
        <div class="detailed-solution">
          <p>Explanation</p>
          <p>The decimal numeral system is base ten.</p>
        </div>
      </solution>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

===================================================
Analyzing Performance on Numerical Input Problems
===================================================

For the numerical input problems in your course, you can use edX Insights to
review aggregated learner performance data and examine submitted answers. For
more information, see :ref:`insights:Using edX Insights`.

***********************************
Adding a Numerical Input Problem
***********************************

You add numerical input problems in Studio by selecting the **Problem**
component type and then using either the simple editor or the advanced editor
to specify the prompt and the acceptable answer or answers.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. note:: You can begin work on the problem in the simple editor, and then
  switch to the advanced editor. However, after you save any changes you make
  in the advanced editor, you cannot switch back to the simple editor.

Before you add a numerical input problem, consider the following features and
limitations of the simple and advanced editors.

* If your problem text contains italics, bold, or special characters, the
  simple editor does not support these values. Use the advanced editor to add
  an HTML paragraph (``<p>``) element and HTML formatting tags as needed.

* If your problem contains a Python script, use the advanced editor.

For example, you must use the advanced editor to define the following numerical
input problem. It contains two questions, one of which relies on character
formatting, and the other that uses a Python script.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/NumericalInput_Complex.png
 :alt: A problem with two questions, both answered correctly in the LMS. One
   question uses italics and superscript in the question, and the other uses a
   script to determine the correct answer.

The OLX for this example follows.

.. note:: The second question in the following example includes a Python
  script. When you add a script to a problem component, do not add to or change
  its internal indentation. A "jailed code" error message appears when you save
  the problem in Studio if the ``<script>`` element is indented.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="9.80665">
        <p>Enter the value of the standard gravity constant <i>g</i>,
         measured in m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <label>What is the answer to the question above?</label>
        <description>Give your answer to at least two decimal places.</description>
        <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.01" />
        <formulaequationinput />
  <script type="loncapa/python">
  computed_response = math.sqrt(math.fsum([math.pow(math.pi,2), math.pow(math.e,2)]))
  </script>
        <solution>
            <div class="detailed-solution">
                <p>Explanation</p>
                <p>The standard gravity constant is defined to be precisely
                 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is 9.80 to two decimal places.
                 Entering 9.8 also works.</p>
            </div>
        </solution>
    </numericalresponse>

    <numericalresponse answer="$computed_response">
        <label>What is the distance in the plane between the points (pi, 0)
         and (0, e)?</label>
        <description>You can type math.</description>
        <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.0001" />
        <formulaequationinput />
        <solution>
            <div class="detailed-solution">
                <p>Explanation</p>
                <p>By the distance formula, the distance between two points in
                 the plane is the square root of the sum of the squares of the
                 differences of each coordinate. Even though an exact numerical
                 value is checked in this case, the easiest way to enter this
                 answer is to type <code>sqrt(pi^2+e^2)</code> into the editor.
                 Other answers like <code>sqrt((pi-0)^2+(0-e)^2)</code> also
                 work.</p>
            </div>
        </solution>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

For more information about including a Python script in a problem, see
:ref:`Write Your Own Grader`.

========================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Add a Numerical Input Problem
========================================================

When you add a numerical input problem, you can choose one of these templates.

* **Numerical Input**

* **Numerical Input with Hints and Feedback**

These templates include the Markdown formatting that you use in the simple
editor to add a problem without, or with, hints and feedback.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Section_simple_editor.rst

.. _Use the Advanced Editor to Add a Numerical Input Problem:

=========================================================
Use the Advanced Editor to Add a Numerical Input Problem
=========================================================

You can use the advanced editor to identify the elements of a numerical input
problem with OLX. For more information, see :ref:`Numerical Input Problem XML`.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Section_advanced_editor.rst

********************
Adding a Tolerance
********************

You can specify a margin of error or tolerance for learner responses. You
can specify a percentage, number, or range.

========================================
Add a Tolerance in the Simple Editor
========================================

To add a tolerance in the simple editor you use the following Markdown
formatting.

* To specify a number on either side of the correct answer, after the answer
  value add ``+-{number}``. For example, to include a tolerance of 5, add
  ``+-5``.

* To specify a percentage on either side of the correct answer, after the
  answer value add ``+-{number}%``. For example, to include a 2% tolerance, add
  ``+-2%``.

========================================
Add a Tolerance in the Advanced Editor
========================================

To add a tolerance in the advanced editor you include a ``<responseparam>``
element with a ``type="tolerance"`` attribute and a ``default`` attribute set
to either a number or a percentage value.

The following example shows a problem with a decimal tolerance.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="ANSWER (NUMBER)">
      <label>Question text</label>
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default=".02" />
      <formulaequationinput />
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

The following example shows a problem with a percentage tolerance.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="ANSWER (NUMBER)">
      <label>Question text</label>
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="3%" />
      <formulaequationinput />
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

**************************
Specifying an Answer Range
**************************

You can specify an answer range so that any learner response within that range
is marked correct. To format an answer range, you provide the starting and
ending values and then separate them with a comma character (``,``). You then
surround the range with bracket (``[ ]``) or parentheses characters (``( )``),
or a combination of one bracket and one parenthesis.

* Use a bracket to include the number next to it in the range, as in a less
  than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, inequality.

* Use a parenthesis to exclude the number from the range, as in a less than or
  greater than inequality.

For example, to identify the correct answers as 5, 6, or 7, but not 8, specify
``[5,8)``. To identify the correct answers as 6, 7, and 8, but not 5, specify
``(5,8]``.

To specify a range in the simple editor, you enter the complete, formatted
range after the equals sign: ``=[5,8)`` or ``=(5,8]``.

To specify a range in the advanced editor, you enter the complete, formatted
range in the ``<numericalresponse>`` element as the value for the ``answer``
attribute: ``<numericalresponse answer="[5,8)">`` or ``<numericalresponse
answer="(5,8]">``

.. _Use Feedback in a Numerical Input Problems:

********************************************
Adding Feedback to a Numerical Input Problem
********************************************

For an overview of feedback in problems, see :ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to
a Problem`. In numerical input problems, you can provide feedback for correct
answers.

.. note::
  You cannot provide feedback for incorrect answers in numerical input
  problems.

Use feedback for numerical input problems to reinforce the process used to
arrive at the correct answer.

=======================================
Configure Feedback in the Simple Editor
=======================================

You can configure feedback in the simple editor. When you add a numerical input
problem, select the template **Numerical Input with Hints and Feedback**. This
template has example formatted feedback that you can replace with your own
text.

In the simple editor, you configure feedback for a numerical input problem with
the following Markdown formatting.

::

  =Correct Answer {{Feedback for the correct answer.}}

For example, the following problem has feedback for the correct answer.

::

  >>What is the arithmetic mean for the following set of numbers? (1, 5, 6, 3, 5)<<

  =4 {{The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.}}

=========================================
Configure Feedback in the Advanced Editor
=========================================

In the advanced editor, you configure answer feedback with the following
syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="Correct Answer">
      <label>Question text</label>
      <formulaequationinput />
      <correcthint>Feedback for the correct answer</correcthint>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

For example, the following problem has feedback for the correct answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="4">
      <label>What is the arithmetic mean for the following set of numbers?
       (1, 5, 6, 3, 5)</label>
      <formulaequationinput />
      <correcthint>The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.</correcthint>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

===========================
Customizing Feedback Labels
===========================

By default, the feedback label shown to learners is **Correct** . If you do
not define a feedback label, learners see this term when they submit a correct
answer, as in the following example.

::

  Correct: The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.

You can configure the problem to override the default label. For example, you
can configure a custom label for the answer.

::

  Good job: The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.

.. note::
  The default label, **Correct**, displays in the learner's requested language.
  If you provide a custom label, it displays as you define it to all learners.
  It is not translated into different languages.

Customize a Feedback Label in the Simple Editor
***********************************************

In the simple editor, you configure a custom feedback label with the following
syntax.

::

  =4 {{Label:: Feedback}}

That is, you provide the label text, followed by two colon (:) characters,
before the feedback text.

For example, the following feedback is configured to use a custom label.

::

  =4 {{Good Job:: The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.}}

Customize a Feedback Label in the Advanced Editor
*************************************************

In the advanced editor, you configure custom feedback labels with the following
syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

    <correcthint label="Custom Label">Feedback</correcthint>

For example, the following feedback is configured to use a custom label.

.. code-block:: xml

  <correcthint label="Good Job">The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.</correcthint>

.. _Use Hints in a Numerical Input Problem:

********************************************
Adding Hints to a Numerical Input Problem
********************************************

You can add hints to a numerical input problem using the simple editor or the
advanced editor. For an overview of hints in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Subsection_configure_hints.rst

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Numerical Input Problem:

*****************************************************
Awarding Partial Credit in a Numerical Input Problem
*****************************************************

You can configure a numerical input problem to award partial credit to learners
who submit an answer that is close or related to the correct answer. You must
use the :ref:`advanced editor<Use the Advanced Editor to Add a Numerical Input
Problem>` to configure partial credit.

.. only:: Partners

 .. note::
    Support for partial credit problems in courses on edx.org and edX
    Edge is provisional. Ensure that you test such problems thoroughly before
    releasing them to learners. For more information, contact your edX partner
    manager.

In the following example, the learner entered an answer that was close to the
correct answer and received partial credit.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/partial_credit_numerical_input.png
 :alt: A numerical input problem with partial credit for a close answer.


For an overview of partial credit in problems, see
:ref:`Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem`.

You can use the following methods to award partial credit in a numerical input
problem.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. note:: You can use these methods of awarding partial credit individually or
 in combination.

==========================
Identifying Close Answers
==========================

You can configure a numerical input problem so that answers that are close to
the correct answer receive partial credit.

To do so, you configure the tolerance for incorrect answers. Learners receive
partial credit for close answers based on the tolerance. By default, the
tolerance is multiplied by 2 and the following rules are applied.

* An answer within the tolerance receives 100% of the points for the problem.

* An answer within or equal to 2x of the tolerance receives 50%.

* An answer more than 2x the outside of the tolerance receives 0%.

You can optionally specify a different multiplier for the tolerance. For
example, you could set the multiplier to 3. In this case, the following rules
apply.

* An answer within the tolerance receives 100% of the points for the problem.

* An answer within or equal to 3x of the tolerance receives 50%.

* An answer more than 3x outside of the tolerance receives 0%.

Configure Close Answers for a Numerical Input Problem
******************************************************

To configure a numerical input problem to award partial credit for close
answers, you add the following attributes to the problem XML.

* Add the ``partial_credit="close"`` attribute to the ``<numericalresponse>``
  element.

  You can use close answers in combination with a list. Set the
  attribute to ``partial_credit="close,list"``.

* Optionally, add the ``partial_range`` attribute to the ``<responseparam>``
  element and set its value to the tolerance multiplier. If you do not set the
  ``partial_range`` attribute, 2 is used as the tolerance multiplier.

For example, the following OLX shows a numerical problem that provides partial
credit for close answers.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="9.3*10^7" partial_credit="close">
      <label>How many miles away from Earth is the sun?</label>
      <description>Use scientific notation to answer.</description>
      <formulaequationinput/>
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" partial_range="3"/>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

=============================================
Awarding Partial Credit for Answers in a List
=============================================

For some numerical input problems, mistakes do not help a learner arrive at the
correct answer. For example, a small mistake can lead to negative instead of
positive results, or to an answer that is off by a square root or numerical
factor.

For these types of problems, you can configure a list of wrong answers that
receive partial credit. Learners who submit answers that are on the list
receive 50% of the problem's points.

Configure a List for a Numerical Input Problem
************************************************

To configure a numerical input problem to award partial credit for answers in a
list, you add the following attributes to the problem XML.

* Add the ``partial_credit="list"`` attribute to the ``<numericalresponse>``
  element.

  You can use a list in combination with close answers. Set the
  attribute to ``partial_credit="close,list"``.

* Add the ``partial_answers`` attribute to the ``<responseparam>`` element. Set
  its value to one or more answers that should earn 50% of the problem's
  points. Separate multiple values by a comma (,).

For example, the following XML shows the numerical problem template
updated to provide partial credit for a different answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="9.3*10^7" partial_credit="close">
      <label>How many miles away from Earth is the sun?</label>
      <description>Use scientific notation to answer.</description>
      <formulaequationinput />
      <responseparam partial_answers="150*10^6"/>
    </numericalresponse>
  </problem>

******************************************
Add Text after the Numeric Response Field
******************************************

You might want to include a word, phrase, or sentence after the response field
in a numerical input problem to help guide your students or resolve ambiguity.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/NI_trailing_text.png
 :width: 500
 :alt: Three numerical input problems with text after the response field:
     "km", a percent sign, and a symbol for meters per second squared.

To do this, you use the advanced editor.

In the problem, locate the ``formulaequationinput`` element. This element
creates the response field for the problem and is a child of the
``numericalresponse`` element.

To add text after the response field, add the ``trailing_text`` attribute
together with the symbol or text that you want to use inside the
``formulaequationinput`` element. An example problem follows with three
questions that use this attribute.

.. note:: You can use MathJax inside the ``trailing_text`` attribute, as the
 third question in this example shows. You cannot use HTML inside this
 attribute.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <numericalresponse answer="12.87">
      <label>How far is 8 miles in kilometers?</label>
      <formulaequationinput trailing_text="km" />
    </numericalresponse>

    <numericalresponse answer="91">
      <label>According to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life
       Project, what percentage of the world's population had a cellular phone
       as of May 2013?</label>
      <formulaequationinput trailing_text="%" />
    </numericalresponse>

    <numericalresponse answer="9.81">
      <label>What is the strength of Earth's gravity, to two decimal places?</label>
      <formulaequationinput trailing_text="\(m/s^{2}\)" />

response. A problem behaves as if all of the code in all of the ``<script>``
elements were in a single ``<script>`` element. Specifically, any variables
that are used in multiple ``<script>`` elements share a namespace and can be
overridden.

As with all Python, indentation matters, even though the code is embedded in
XML.
