Overview
**********

In numerical input problems, learners enter numbers or specific and relatively
simple mathematical expressions to answer a question. The text that the
learners enter is converted to a symbolic expression that appears below the
response field.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/NumericalInputExample.png
 :alt: A problem with two questions, one answered correctly and one
     incorrectly.

Responses for numerical input problems can include integers, fractions, and
constants such as pi and *g*. Responses can also include text representing
common functions, such as square root (sqrt) and log base 2 (log2), as well as
trigonometric functions and their inverses, such as sine (sin) and arcsine
(arcsin). For these functions, learners enter text that is converted into
mathematical symbols. The following example shows a response entered by a
learner and the numerical expression that results.

 :alt: A learner typed n*x^(n-1) to enter the symbolic expression n times x to
     the n minus 1 power.

For more information about how learners enter expressions, see `Math Response
Formatting for Students`_.

You can specify a margin of error, or tolerance, for the answers to these
problems so that learners' responses do not have to be exact. You can 
specify a correct answer explicitly or use a Python script.

**************************************************
Analyzing Performance on Numerical Input Problems
**************************************************

For the numerical input problems in your course, you can use edX Insights to
review aggregated learner performance data and examine submitted answers. For
more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

***********************************
Creating a Numerical Input Problem 
***********************************

You can create numerical problems in the Simple Editor or in the Advanced
Editor. 

* If the text of your problem does not include any italics, bold formatting,
  or special characters, you can create the problem in the Simple Editor. 
* If the text of your problem contains special formatting or characters, or if
  your problem contains a Python script, you use the Advanced Editor.

For example, you must use the Advanced Editor to define the following problems.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/NumericalInput_Complex.png
 :alt: A problem that requires a square root as the answer.

In this example, the question uses a Python script to compute the square root.

For more information about including a Python script in your problem, see
:ref:`Write Your Own Grader`.

.. _Use the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem:

========================================================================
Use the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem
========================================================================

To the :ref:`Simple Editor<Simple Editor>` to create a numerical input
problem, follow these steps.

#. In the unit where you want to create the problem, under **Add New
   Component** select **Problem**.
#. Select one of the two numerical input problem templates.
   
   * From the list of **Common Problem Types**, select **Numerical Input**. 
   
   * From the list of **Common Problems with Hints and Feedback**, select
     **Numerical Input with Hints and Feedback**. For more information, see
     `Use Feedback in a Numerical Input Problems`_.

    Studio adds the problem to the unit.

#. Select **Edit**. The Simple Editor opens. 
#. Replace the sample problem text with your own text.
#. Determine the text that describes the question you want learners to answer,
   and surround that text with two pairs of angle brackets (``>>question<<``).
   This question text is the accessible label for the problem.
   question text is the accessible label for the problem.
#. To identify the problem's answer, select the answer text and then select
   **Numerical Input** from the toolbar. An equals sign appears
   next to the answer.
#. Optionally, specify a margin of error, or tolerance. You can specify a
   percentage, number, or range.
   
   * To specify a percentage on either side of the correct answer, after the
     answer add **+-{number}%**. For example, to include a 2% tolerance, add
     **+-2%**.

   * To specify a number on either side of the correct answer, after the
     answer add **+-{number}**. For example, to include a tolerance of 5, add
     **+-5**.

   * To specify a range, you provide the starting and ending values separated
     by a comma and then surround the range with brackets [] or parentheses ().
     A bracket includes the number next to it in the range, and a parenthesis
     excludes the number from the range. For example, if you specify **[5,
     8)**, correct answers can be 5, 6, and 7, but not 8. Likewise, if you
     specify **(5, 8]**, correct answers can be 6, 7, and 8, but not 5.

#. To provide an explanation, select the explanation text and then select 
   **Explanation** from the toolbar. ``[explanation]`` appears before
   and after the explanation text.
#. Select **Settings** and provide an identifying **Display Name** for the
   problem.
#. Define additional settings for the problem. For more information, see
   :ref:`Problem Settings`.
#. Select **Save**.

For the first example problem illustrated above, the text in the problem
component appears as follows.

::

   >>What base is the decimal numeral system in?<<

   = 10
    
   [explanation]
   The decimal numeral system is base ten.
   [explanation]

========================================================================
Use the Advanced Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem 
========================================================================

For a more complex problem, such as the one that follows, you use the Advanced
Editor.

#. Follow the steps for creating the problem in the :ref:`Simple Editor<Use
   the Simple Editor to Create a Numerical Input Problem>`. 
#. Select **Advanced Editor**, and then edit the XML to add the tags and
   attributes you want. An example follows.

**Problem Code**:

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem>
    <p><b>Example Problem</b></p>

  <legend>What base is the decimal numeral system in?</legend>
      <numericalresponse answer="10">
          <formulaequationinput label="What base is the decimal numeral system in?"/>
      </numericalresponse>
  </p>

    <legend>What is the value of the standard gravity constant <i>g</i>, measured in m/s<sup>2</sup>? Give your answer to at least two decimal places.</legend>
    <numericalresponse answer="9.80665">
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.01" />
      <formulaequationinput label="Give your answer to at least two decimal places"/>
    </numericalresponse>

  <!-- The following lines use Python script spacing. Make sure it is not indented when you add it to the problem component. -->
  <script type="loncapa/python">
  computed_response = math.sqrt(math.fsum([math.pow(math.pi,2), math.pow(math.e,2)]))
  </script>

  <legend>What is the distance in the plane between the points (pi, 0) and (0, e)? You can type math.</legend>
      <numericalresponse answer="$computed_response">
          <responseparam type="tolerance" default="0.0001" />
          <formulaequationinput label="What is the distance in the plane between the points (pi, 0) and (0, e)?"/>
      </numericalresponse>
  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The decimal numerical system is base ten.</p>
      <p>The standard gravity constant is defined to be precisely 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
      This is 9.80 to two decimal places. Entering 9.8 also works.</p>
      <p>By the distance formula, the distance between two points in the plane is
         the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences of each coordinate.
        Even though an exact numerical value is checked in this case, the
        easiest way to enter this answer is to type
        <code>sqrt(pi^2+e^2)</code> into the editor.
        Other answers like <code>sqrt((pi-0)^2+(0-e)^2)</code> also work.

.. _Use Feedback in a Numerical Input Problems:

********************************************
Using Feedback in a Numerical Input Problems
********************************************

You can add feedback in a numerical input problem using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of feedback in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

In numerical input problems, you can provide feedback for correct answers. 

.. note:: 
  You cannot provide feedback for incorrect answers in numerical input
  problems.

Use feedback for the correct answer to reinforce the process for arriving at
the numerical value.

=======================================
Configure Feedback in the Simple Editor
=======================================

In the :ref:`Simple Editor<Simple Editor>`, you configure answer feedback with
the following syntax. When you create a new numerical input problem, select the
template  **Numerical Input with Hints and Feedback**. This template has
example feedback syntax that you can replace.

::

  = Numerical Answer {{Feedback for the correct answer.}}

For example, the following problem has feedback for each possible answer.

::

  >>What is the arithmetic mean for the following set of numbers? 
    (1, 5, 6, 3, 5)<<

  = 4 {{The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.}}

=========================================
Configure Feedback in the Advanced Editor
=========================================

In the :ref:`Advanced Editor<Advanced Editor>`, you configure answer feedback
with the following syntax.   

.. code-block:: xml

    <numericalresponse answer="Correct Answer">
      <formulaequationinput label="Question" />
      <correcthint>
        Feedback for the correct answer.
      </correcthint>
    </numericalresponse>

For example, the following problem has feedback for the correct answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <numericalresponse answer="4">
    <formulaequationinput label="What is the arithmetic mean for the following 
      set of numbers? (1, 5, 6, 3, 5)" />
    <correcthint>
      The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.
    </correcthint>
  </numericalresponse>

=========================
Customize Feedback Labels
=========================

By default, the feedback label for correct answers is **Correct** . If you do
not define a feedback label, learners see this term when they submit a correct
answer, as in the following example.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/numerical_input_feedback.png
 :alt: Image of numerical input feedback with the standard label.
 :width: 600

You can configure the problem to override the default labels. For example, you
can configure a custom label for the answer.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/numerical_input_feedback_custom_label.png
 :alt: Image of numerical input feedback with a custom label.
 :width: 600

.. note::
  The default label **Correct** is displayed in the learner's requested
  language. If you provide a custom label, it is displayed to all users as you
  configure it and is not translated into different languages.

Customize Feedback Labels in the Simple Editor
***********************************************

In the :ref:`Simple Editor<Simple Editor>`, you configure a custom feedback
label with the following syntax.

::

  = 4 {{Label::Feedback}}

For example, the following feedback is configured to use a custom label.

::

  = 4 {{Good Job::The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.}}

Customize Feedback Labels in the Advanced Editor
*************************************************

In the :ref:`Advanced Editor<Advanced Editor>`, you configure custom feedback
labels with the following syntax.

.. code-block:: xml

    <correcthint label="Custom Label">
      Feedback
    </correcthint>

For example, the following feedback is configured to use a custom label.

.. code-block:: xml

  <correcthint label="Good Job">
    The mean for this set of numbers is 20 / 5 which equals 4.
  </correcthint>

.. _Use Hints in a Numerical Input Problem:

********************************************
Using Hints in a Numerical Input Problem
********************************************

You can use hints in a numerical input problem, using the simple editor
or the advanced editor. For an overview of hints in problems, see
:ref:`Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem`.

.. include:: ../../../shared/exercises_tools/Subsection_configure_hints.rst

.. _Awarding Partial Credit in a Numerical Input Problem:

*****************************************************
Awarding Partial Credit in a Numerical Input Problem
*****************************************************

You can configure a numerical input problem to have partial credit awarded to
learners who submit an answer that is close or related to the correct answer.
You must use the `Advanced Editor <Use the Advanced Editor to Edit a Numerical
Input Problem>`_ to configure partial credit.

In the following example, the learner entered an answer that was close to the
correct answer and received partial credit.

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/partial_credit_numerical_input.png
 :alt: Image of a numerical input problem with partial credit for a close
     answer.
 :width: 600

For an overview of partial credit in problems, see
:ref:`Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem`.

There are two ways to award partial credit in a numerical input problem.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. Note:: You can use these ways of awarding partial credit in combination.

==========================
Identifying Close Answers
==========================

You can configure a numerical input problem so that answers that are close to
the correct answer receive partial credit.

You configure the tolerance for incorrect answers. Learners receive partial
credit for close answers based on the tolerance. By default, the tolerance is
multiplied by 2 and the following rules are applied.

* An answer within the tolerance receives 100% of the points for the problem.

* An answer within or equal to 2x of the tolerance receives 50%.

* An answer more than 2x the outside of the tolerance receives 0%.

You can optionally specify a different multiplier for the tolerance. For
example, you could set the multiplier to 3. In this case, the following rules
are applied.

* An answer within the tolerance receives 100% of the points for the problem.

* An answer within or equal to 3x of the tolerance receives 50%.

* An answer more than 3x outside of the tolerance receives 0%.

Configure Close Answers for a Numerical Input Problem
******************************************************

To configure a numerical input problem to award partial credit for close
answers, you add the following attributes to the problem XML.

* Add the ``"partial_credit="close"`` attribute to the ``<numericalresponse>``
  element. If you are using close answers in combination with a list, set the
  attribute to ``partial_credit="close,list"``.

* Optionally, add the ``partial_range`` attribute to the ``<responseparam>``
  element and set its value to the tolerance multiplier. If you do not set the
  ``partial_range`` attribute, 2 is used as the tolerance multiplier.

For example, the following XML shows the numerical problem template
updated to provide partial credit for close answers.

.. code-block:: xml

  <numericalresponse answer="9.3*10^7" partial_credit="close">
    <formulaequationinput label="How many miles away from Earth is the sun? 
      Use scientific notation to answer." />
    <responseparam type="tolerance" default="1%" partial_range="3"/>
  </numericalresponse>

=============================================
Awarding Partial Credit for Answers in a List
=============================================

For some numerical input problems, mistakes do not get a learner close to the
right answer. For example, a small mistake can lead to negative instead of
positive results, or to an answer that is off by a square root or numerical
factor.

For these types of problems, you can configure a list of wrong answers that
receive partial credit. Learners who submit answers that are on the list
receive 50% of the problem's points.


Configure a List for a Numerical Input Problem
************************************************

To configure a numerical input problem to award partial credit for answers in a
list, you add the following attributes to the problem XML.

* Add the ``partial_credit="list"`` attribute to the ``<numericalresponse>``
  element. If you are a list in combination with close answers, set the
  attribute to ``partial_credit="close,list"``.

* Add the ``partial_answers`` attribute to the ``<responseparam>`` element. Set
  its value to one or more answers that should earn 50% of the problem's
  points. Separate multiple values by a comma (,).

For example, the following XML shows the numerical problem template
updated to provide partial credit for a different answer.

.. code-block:: xml

  <numericalresponse answer="93*10^7" partial_credit="list">
    <formulaequationinput label="How many miles away from Earth is the sun? 
      Use scientific notation to answer." />
    <responseparam partial_answers="150*10^6"/>
  </numericalresponse>
