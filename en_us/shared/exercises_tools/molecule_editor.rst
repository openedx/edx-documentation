Molecule Editor Tool
#######################

.. note:: EdX does not support this tool.

Learners can use the molecule editor to learn how to create molecules. The
molecule editor allows learners to draw molecules that follow the rules for
covalent bond formation and formal charge, even if the molecules are chemically
impossible, are unstable, or do not exist in living systems. The molecule
editor warns learners if they try to submit a structure that is chemically
impossible.

The molecule editor incorporates two tools: the JSME molecule editor created by
Peter Erl and Bruno Bienfait, and JSmol, a JavaScript-based molecular viewer
from Jmol. (You don't need to download either of these tools--Studio uses them
automatically.) For more information about the JSME molecule editor, see `JSME
Molecule Editor <http://peter-ertl.com/jsme/index.html>`_. For more information
about JSmol, see `JSmol <http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmol/>`_.

.. _Create the Molecule Editor:

******************************
Create the Molecule Editor
******************************

To create a molecule editor, you need the following files.

* MoleculeAnswer.png
* MoleculeEditor_HTML.png
* dopamine.mol

To download all of these files in a .zip archive, go to
http://files.edx.org/MoleculeEditorFiles.zip.

.. note:: The molecule that appears when the tool starts is a dopamine
 molecule. To use a different molecule, download the .mol file for that
 molecule from the `list of molecules
 <http://www.biotopics.co.uk/jsmol/molecules/>`_ on the `BioTopics
 <http://www.biotopics.co.uk/>`_ website. Then, upload the .mol file to the
 **Files & Uploads** page for your course in Studio, and change "dopamine.mol"
 in the example code to the name of your .mol file.

To create the molecule editor that appears in the image above, you need an HTML
component followed by a problem component.

#. Upload all of the files listed above to the **Files & Uploads** page in your
   course.
#. Create the HTML component.

  #. In the unit where you want to create the problem, click **HTML** under
     **Add New Component**, and then click **HTML**.
  #. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
  #. In the component editor, paste the HTML component code from below.
  #. Make any changes that you want, and then click **Save**.

#. Create the problem component.

  #. Under the HTML component, click **Problem** under **Add New Component**,
     and then click **Blank Advanced Problem**.
  #. In the component that appears, click **Edit**.
  #. In the component editor, paste the problem component code from below.
  #. Click **Save**.

  <p>The chemical editor you are using ensures that the structures you draw are correct in one very narrow sense, that they follow the rules for covalent bond formation and formal charge. However, there are many structures that follow these rules that are chemically impossible, unstable, do not exist in living systems, or are beyond the scope of this course. The editor will let you draw them because, in contrast to the rules of formal charge, these properties cannot be easily and reliably predicted from structures.</p>
  <p>If you submit a structure that includes atoms that are not possible or are beyond the scope of this course, the software will warn you specifically about these parts of your structure and you will be allowed to edit your structure and re-submit. Submitting an improper structure will not count as one of your tries. In general, you should try to use only the atoms most commonly cited in this course: C, H, N, O, P, and S. If you want to learn about formal charge, you can play around with other atoms and unusual configurations and look at the structures that result.</p>
