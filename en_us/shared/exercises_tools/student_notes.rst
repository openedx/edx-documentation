.. note:: The Student Notes tool is available for text, including text in 
 HTML components. However, the tool is currently not available for discussions,
 exercises, video transcripts, or PDF documents.

Students can access their notes either in the body of the course or on a
**Notes** tab. On the **Notes** tab, a student can see all the notes that the
student has made during the course. It also contains links to the location of
the notes in the course content.
