Starting a Course
********************

This section describes how to start a course and begin doing course work, and
how to change settings that apply to a specific course.

As soon as you enroll in a course, you can access some information about the
course and change course-specific settings on your :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner
Dashboard>`. You cannot access course lessons or assignments.

After the course start date, you can start working in the course.

.. _Start Date and Duration:

===========================
Find a Course's Start Date
===========================

Often, you can enroll in a course before it actually starts. You can find the
course start date on your dashboard; however, the exact time is not published.

* You do not need to sign in exactly when the course begins.

* If the course content is not immediately available, check back later on the
  start date.

To find the course start date, follow these steps.

#. At the top of any page, select the dropdown menu icon next to your
   username.

#. Select **Dashboard**. Your dashboard lists every course that you are
   enrolled in.

#. Locate the course in the list of courses on your dashboard.

   * For courses that have not yet started, "Starts" and the date appear
     below the name of the course.

   * For courses that are already in progress, "Started" and the date appear.

   * If the course team has not yet announced the start date, a message such as
     "Coming Soon" appears.

   * For archived courses that are no longer running, "Ended" and
     the date appear.

Start a Course
===============

To start work in a course that is in progress, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Course**. The course **Home** page opens. This page shows
   important dates and, typically, a welcome message from the course team.

#. Select **Course**. The first section of course content opens.

==============================
View an Archived Course
==============================

You can enroll or continue to work in some courses even after the course end
date. These courses are archived, which means that while you can access the
course content, you cannot submit answers for graded problems or participate in
course discussions.

To view the content of an archived course, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course.

#. Select **View Archived Course**.

======================
View a Course Grade
======================

To view your current grade in a course that has not yet ended, see :ref:`SFD
Check Progress`.

To view your final grade in a course that you have completed, follow these
steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course. Your final grade appears under the
   course name.

#. Optionally, print your dashboard to obtain a record of your achievement in
   the course.

You can also view the course and open its **Progress** page to view your final
grade, as well as your grades on all course assignments.

======================
Access a Certificate
======================

If you earn a certificate for a course, options to access your certificate are
available on your dashboard soon after the course ends. For more courses,
certificates are available within two weeks.

To access the certificate that you have earned in a course, locate the course
on your dashboard. Next to the course name is an option for accessing the
certificate. For example, the option might be **View Certificate** or
**Download Your ID Verified Certificate (PDF)**.

  =====================================
  Check Your ID Verification Status
  =====================================

  If you have enrolled in the verified certificate track for a course, your
  dashboard provides the status of your ID verification. To check the status,
  follow these steps.

  #. On your dashboard, locate the course. Your ID verification status appears
     with the course image for that course.

  For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD Verify Your Identity`.
