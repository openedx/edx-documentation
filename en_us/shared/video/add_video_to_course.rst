=======================
Add a Video
=======================

To add a video to an edge.edx.org course, follow these steps.

#. In studo, locate the unit that you want, an then select **Video** under **Add New
   Component**.

#. Select the **pencil icon**, in the top left hand corner, and enter the name that
   you want learners to see for this video as the Component Display Name. Clicking
   the "Check" icon will save your changes, the "X" icon will discard them.

   This name appears as a heading above the video in the LMS, and it identifies the
   video for you in Insights. If you do not enter a display name, the platform
   specifies "Video" for you.

#. Locate the **Video URL field**, and then enter the location of your video.
   This is the URL that was created when you uploaded the video to the hosting site.

   .. note::
      If you have created multiple versions that use different encodings or hosting
      services, add the URL for each video by selecting **Add a vido URL** below the
      **Fallback Videos** field and enter the URL in the **Video URL** field. The first
      listed video that is compatible with the learner's device plays.

      For the best experience for mobile users, make sure that the URL for the 360p
      version of the video is the first URL in the list.

#. Optionally, you can set more options for the video. For a description of each option,
   see :ref:`Video Settings`.
