    For courses on edx.org, you do not have to set up a hosting service to
    store your videos. You can skip to :ref:`Create a Video`.

    For Edge courses, you must work with a third party hosting site to make
    your videos available for streaming or download.

   You must work with a third party hosting site to make your videos available
   for streaming or download.

To host your videos, you can use any video hosting site that you want. Many
courses use `Amazon S3`_. When you select a video hosting site, we strongly
recommend that you keep the following information in mind.

* The hosting site might have to handle high traffic volume.
* Not all hosting sites are available in all countries or regions. We recommend
  that you upload videos to more than one hosting site.
* Learners' internet connections vary widely. We recommend that you make your
  videos available for both download and streaming.
* The URL for your videos must end in .mp4, .mpeg, .webm, or .ogg. The video
  player cannot support videos that you upload on sites such as Vimeo.

  .. note::
    To help make sure all standard browsers can play your video, we strongly
    recommend that you use .mp4 format.
