Transcripts are required for all videos. Transcripts help learners with
hearing impairments understand audio content, and they are helpful for learners
who speak other languages.

Transcripts are available to learners in the following ways.

* Learners can select the **Show transcript** (”) icon in the video player’s
  control bar to show the transcript next to the video. The transcript
  automatically scrolls as the video plays. Learners can select a line in the
  transcript to jump to the point in the video where that line is spoken.
* Learners can show the transcript file as overlaid closed captions for the
  video by selecting the **CC** icon in the video player’s control bar.
* You can allow learners to download transcripts so that learners can read the
  transcripts offline. For more information, see :ref:`Enable Video and
  Transcript Downloads`.

Obtaining a Video Transcript
****************************

To obtain a transcript in .srt format, you can work with a transcript
provider such as `3Play Media`_ or `cielo24`_.
.. note::
  Transcripts must be in the SubRip Text (.srt)
  format. We strongly recommend that you format your .srt files as plain text
  with no encoding. Encodings such as ``UTF-8`` and ``ANSI - Western Roman``
  can cause errors.

  If you use a third party transcript provider other than 3Play Media or
  cielo24, make sure that your finished transcripts are in .srt format.

When you work with a transcript provider, you send your videos to the
transcript provider, and the provider sends you the completed transcripts.
You later upload the transcripts when you :ref:`create a video
component<opencoursestaff:Add a Video to a Course>`.

**********************************
Transcript File Naming Conventions
**********************************

To prevent errors when you upload your video transcripts, we recommend the
following conventions for naming your transcript files.

* Give each transcript file an identifying name that is unique across all of
  your course uploads, including non-transcript files.
* Make sure that the transcript contains no special characters, such as ç, å,
  or ó.
* Make sure that the file type (``.srt``) is in lowercase.
* Do not include periods in file names other than the period before the .srt
  file type.
