************************************
Add a Transcript
************************************

You can provide transcripts for your video in more than one language. To do
this, you work with a third-party service to obtain an .srt transcript file for
each language, and then associate the .srt file with the video in Studio.

Before you add a transcript file, make sure that each file has a unique name.
If you use the same transcript name more than once, only the most recently
added transcript will appear for every video component that is set up to use a
transcript with that name. To avoid this problem, a best practice is to name
additional transcript files by appending the transcript's language to the video
file name.

For example, you have two videos, named video1.mp4 and video2.mp4, and their
original transcripts are named video1.srt and video2.srt. When you add Hindi
transcripts for these videos, you name them video1_hi.srt and video2_hi.srt.
When you add Spanish transcripts for the videos, you name them video1_es.srt
and video2_es.srt.

To add a transcript to a video component, follow these steps.

#. After you obtain the .srt files for additional languages, open the
   video component for the video.

#. Scroll down to the **Transcript** section, and then select **Add a
   transcript**.

#. Select the language for the transcript that you want to add.

#. In the dialog box, browse to the .srt file for the transcript in that
   language, and then select **Open**.

#. Repeat steps 2 - 5 for any additional languages.

When your learners view the video, they can select the **Language menu** to
select a language.

  .. note::
   If you need to edit an integrated transcript from 3Play Media or cielo24,
   contact your edX project coordinator. Do not use this procedure.

#. In Studio, open the video component for the video.
#. For an .srt transcript, locate the **Transcript** section, and then select
   the **menu icon (•••)** for the desired language and select **Download**.
#. After the file downloads, open a text editor and make any changes that you
   want.
#. Select the **menu icon (•••)** and select **Replace** to upload the edited
   file for the same language.

******************************************
Add a Supplemental Downloadable Transcript
******************************************

.. note::
  You can also use this procedure to upload a different kind of handout for
  learners to download, such as an image or a chart.

By default, a .txt file is created when you upload an .srt file, and learners
can download either the .srt or .txt transcript when you allow transcript
downloads. For more information about allowing transcript downloads, see
:ref:`Enable Video and Transcript Downloads`.

In addition, you can provide a downloadable transcript in a format such as
.pdf. To do this, you upload the additional transcript in the video player as a
handout. Learners see an option to download the handout below the video.

To add another downloadable transcript, follow these steps.

#. Create or obtain your transcript as a .pdf or in another format.
#. Locate the **Handout** section, and then select **Upload Handout**.
#. In the dialog box, select the file on your computer, and then select
   **Open**.
