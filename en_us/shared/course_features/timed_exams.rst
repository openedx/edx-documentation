**********
Overview
**********

You can configure a :ref:`subsection <Developing Course Subsections>`
in your course so that learners have a set amount of time to complete and
submit all problems in that subsection.

Although you can configure an ungraded subsection to be timed, typically you set
a time limit on graded subsections, such as for mid-term or final exams.

When learners take a timed exam, a timer on the exam page counts down and
provides alerts as the time limit approaches. When no time remains, learners
can no longer access additional exam content, or submit additional responses
to the subsection. All problems that were completed are graded. No points are
awarded for unsubmitted problems.

Course teams can grant individual learners more time to complete problems in
the subsection, but only if learners request additional time **before**
starting a timed exam.

.. note::
  Learners cannot complete timed exams using the edX mobile app.

To better understand the learner's experience of timed exams, see
:ref:`learners:taking_timed_exams` in the *edX Learner's Guide* or
:ref:`openlearners:taking_timed_exams` in the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

.. only:: Partners

  Timed exams are different from :ref:`proctored exams<CA_ProctoredExams>`.
  While both types of exams have a time limit, learners are monitored only
  during proctored exams.


*******************
Enable Timed Exams
*******************

Timed exams are automatically enabled in your course.
If you want to disable timed exams, you should go to each subsection that
is set to be a "timed" exam, and set it to "none".

.. note::

   The **Enable Timed Exams** field is now deprecated in the
   **Advanced Settings** page. If you want to access the field, you'll need
   to click on the "Show Deprecated Settings" button on the **Advanced Settings**
   page.


*****************************
Set a Subsection to be Timed
*****************************

Ensure that you have enabled timed exams in the course. Then follow these
steps.

#. Add and :ref:`develop a subsection <Developing Course Subsections>` as you
   would any other subsection.

#. Select the **Configure** icon for the subsection.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/subsections-settings-icon.png
    :alt: A subsection in the course outline with the configure icon indicated.
    :width: 600

   The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. In the **Grading** section, set the :ref:`assignment type and due date<Set
   the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>` for the subsection.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab.

   .. only:: Open_edX

    If the **Settings** dialog box does not contain the **Advanced** tab, timed
    exams might not be enabled for your Open edX site. Enabling timed exams for
    an Open edX site is a task that is usually performed by a system
    administrator. For more information, see :ref:`Enable Timed
    Exams` in *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform*.

#. In the **Set as a Special Exam** section, select **Timed**.

   .. only:: Partners

     If your course has the proctored exam feature enabled, the
     **Advanced** tab also shows options for :ref:`proctored and practice
     proctored exams<CA_ProctoredExams>`.

#. In the **Time Allotted** field, enter the length of time that you want
   learners to have to complete the problems in the subsection. Enter the time
   as HH:MM, where HH is hours and MM is minutes.

#. Select **Save**.

.. _Grant Learners More Time for a Timed Exam:

.. note::
  The course grace period setting does not apply to timed or proctored exams.
  For more information about the grace period setting, see :ref:`Set the Grace
  Period`.

From the instructor dashboard, a course team member can grant learners
extra time to complete a timed or proctored exam.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Special Exams**.

#. Expand **Allowance Section**.

#. Select **Add Allowance**.

   The **Add a New Allowance** dialog box opens.

#. For **Username** or **Email**, enter all the learners' emails/usernames seperated by a comma that you wish to add an exception for.

#. For **Select Exam Type**, select the type of exams you want to add extra time for, either proctored or timed exams.

#. For **Select Exams**, click on the desired exams you want extra time for.

#. For **Allowance Type**, select either **Additional Time** or **Time Multiplier**

#. If you selected **Additional Time**, enter the number of extra minutes that you
   want to grant to the learner.

   .. note:: You must enter a whole number greater than 0.

#. Otherwise if you selected **Time Multiplier**, enter the multiplier for how much total time you want the learners to have.
For example for an exam of 30 minutes, a multiplier of 1.5 will give 15 extra minutes to each learner.

   .. note:: You must enter a number greater than 1.

#. Select **Create Allowance**.

For proctored exams, the reviewer takes the special allowance for extra time
into account when the proctoring service reviews the learner’s proctored exam
results.

.. _Resuming an Exam in an Error State:

**********************************
Resuming an Exam in an Error State
**********************************

If a learner encounters an error while taking a timed or proctored exam, you
can allow them to resume the exam with their answers and time remaining saved.

   state. This can be seen by following the directions below.

.. note::
   Onboarding and practice exams can be self-service reset by the learner. See
   `Checking Your Onboarding Status and Resetting Your Onboarding Exam`_ in the
   edX Help Center.

To allow a learner to resume a timed or proctored exam attempt, follow these
steps.

#. View the live version of your course.
#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Special Exam**.
#. Expand **Student Special Exam Attempts**. A list of timed and proctored exam
   attempts appears.

#. In the **Exam Name** column, locate the name of the specific exam for which
   you are resuming the learner's exam attempt.
#. In the **Actions** column, click the gear icon (⚙) and select **Resume**.
   A message displays asking you to confirm that you want to resume the learner's
   exam attempt.
#. Select **OK**. The learner's exam attempt status will change from **Error**
   to **Ready to Resume**, and they will be able to access the exam again.

      icon (⚙) in place of the **Reset** button. Click this icon in order
      to display the **Reset** and **Resume** options. For more information on
      resuming an exam attempt, see :ref:`Resuming an Exam in an Error State`.
#. Select **OK**. The learner's exam attempt is removed from the list.


*****************************************
Hide a Timed Exam After Its Due Date
*****************************************

Timed exams are hidden from learners after they complete and submit their
exams, but are available again for viewing after the exam due date has passed.
You can configure a timed exam to remain hidden even after the exam due date
has passed.

When you keep a timed exam hidden after its due date, learners cannot see the
content of the exam, but the grades that they received on the exam are not
affected, and their scores for the exam remain visible on the **Progress** page.

.. note:: This setting applies only to timed exams. It has no effect on other
   types of special exams, including proctored or practice exams.


#. In Studio, select the **Configure** icon for the timed exam (subsection)
   that you want to configure.

   The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. Select the **Visibility** tab.

#. In the **Subsection Visibility** section, select **Hide content after due date**.

#. Select **Save**.
