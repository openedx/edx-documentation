Managing Team Discussions 
#########################

EdX recommends that you designate course staff and optionally student TAs to
moderate team discussions. The same discussion administration roles for
managing course discussions on the **Discussions** page apply to discussion
administration for team discussions. Course team members and student TAs who
already have discussion moderation roles for course discussions on the
**Discussions** page can perform the same roles for discussions in teams.

For information about discussion administration roles, see
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. For information about managing discussions,
see :ref:`Running_discussions`.
