Managing Team Discussions
#########################

EdX recommends that you designate course staff and optionally student teaching
assistants (TAs) to moderate team discussions. The same discussion
administration roles for managing course discussions on the **Discussions** page
apply to discussion administration for team discussions. Course team members and
student TAs who already have discussion moderation roles for course discussions
on the **Discussions** page can perform the same roles for discussions in teams.

For information about discussion administration roles, see
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. For information about managing discussions,
see :ref:`Running_discussions`.
