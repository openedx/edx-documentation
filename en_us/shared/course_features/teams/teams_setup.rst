*******************************
Teams Overview
*******************************

Using teams in your course is an effective way for learners to interact and
collaborate on small group projects or activities. You define topics that
learners choose from; learners choose a topic they are interested in, and
either join a team or create their own team within that topic. Each learner
can belong to only one team.

When learners create a new team, they add names and descriptions to identify
their team. They can also optionally specify a primary communication language
and a primary country that members identify with. Team characteristics might
serve as the basis for attracting new members, resulting in small groups of
learners with similar interests and goals who will work together on projects
or activities within the same topic area.

Teams are most effective when learners have a clear reason for joining a team,
and a clear outcome to achieve with fellow team members. For example, you
might create an assignment that consists of a group project or activity, with
a choice of topics, and ask learners to join teams within the topic of their
choice to complete the assignment. Team members can use discussions within the
team to communicate and collaborate on the assignment. If you want only to
provide a way for learners to connect socially, consider using discussions
within the course rather than teams. For more information about
using discussions, see :ref:`Running_discussions`.


.. _Enable and Configure Teams:

*******************************
Enable and Configure Teams
*******************************

To disable or enable the Teams application, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Click the gear icon on the **Teams** card shown on this page.
#. From the **Configure teams** modal, select the toggle to enable or disable the **teams application**.
#. Select **Apply** to save your configuration changes.


.. note:: The **Teams** page in the LMS becomes available only after you have
   specified at least one team topic.

There are several configuration options available to the Teams application.
Many basic configuration options are provided within Studioâ€™s Pages & Resources area,
and course management capabilities are available to instructors directly from the Teams application.
Included below are details about both the configuration options and management tools.

To change access to the course team configuration options, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Content** menu select **Pages & Resources**.
#. Click the gear icon on the **Teams** card shown on this page.
#. From the Configure team modal, adjust any of the configuration settings as described below to fit your course needs.
#. Select **Apply** to save your configuration changes.

**Default Team Size**

This specifies the maximum number of learners that can join a team, a default value for all teams in your course.
This default value can be overridden for a specific team group as well.

**Team Groups:**

Each team group is a grouping for multiple learner teams. To start, each of these team groups must be given a
unique name, and optionally a description can also be set.

These names and descriptions are visible to learners in the Teams application as shown in the visual below.

     :alt: The navigation bar in the LMS, showing the default pages.


.. note::  EdX recommends that you do not delete topics once your course is
   running, and if learners might have already joined teams within topics. If
   you delete a topic from the **Teams Configuration** policy key, that topic
   is no longer visible in the LMS, and learners will not be able to leave
   teams associated with the deleted topic.


**Team Group Size Override**

Separate from the team maximum size setting, it is possible to override the specific team size for
a given team group, allowing you to adjust team sizes to fit your course needs.

.. _Create a Team:

******************
Create a Team
******************

Although learners in your course can create their own teams, you can seed each
topic with a few teams to give learners some ideas for their own teams.

Course team members who have the **Staff**, **Admin**, **Discussion Admin**,
or **Discussion Moderator** role can create new teams within topics.
**Community TAs** and learners in the course can also create teams, although
learners can create a new team only if they do not already belong to one.

To create a team, follow these steps.

#. From the **Teams** page in the LMS, select **Browse**, then select the
   topic in which you want to create a team.

#. At the bottom of the list of teams within the topic, select the **create a
   new team in this topic** link.

3. On the **Create a New Team** page, add a name and description for the team.

   In the description, include details about the proposed project or activity
   to help learners to decide whether they want to join this team.

   .. image:: ../../../../shared/images/Teams_CreateNewTeamForm.png

     :alt: Empty form with fields to be completed when you create a new team.

#. Optionally, add some characteristics for your team. You can specify a
   language that members would primarily use to communicate with each other,
   and a country that members would primarily identify with. Keep in mind that
   if your team details make the team membership seem too selective, learners
   might be discouraged from joining.

#. When you have finished entering details for the team, select **Create**.

   Your new team is added to the list of teams under your selected topic.
