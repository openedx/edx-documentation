Managing Proctored Exams

When you administer a proctored exam in your course, learners might have
questions or concerns about the exam. Usually, you can direct learners to the
FAQ section on edx.org, the :ref:`online proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring
Rules>`, or to :ref:`learners:SFD_ProctoredExams` in the *edX Learner’s Guide*
to answer their questions.

If learners need accommodations for disabilities, or have a technical problem
with the exam, you work with edX support to determine a solution on a
case by case basis.

.. _Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams:

**************************************
Accommodate Learners with Disabilities
**************************************

You can make a special policy accommodation to the exam policy for a particular
learner, such as allowing an additional person to help a blind learner.

.. note::
  Make sure the learner who has requested special accommodations, including
  additional time, does not start taking the proctored exam before you set up
  the accommodation.

  If you need to allow more time for the learner, see :ref:`Grant
  Learners More Time for a Timed Exam`.

To make a special policy accommodation for a learner, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Special Exams**.

#. Expand **Allowance Section**.

#. Select **Add Allowance**.

   The **Add a New Allowance** dialog box opens.

#. For **Special Exam**, select the subsection that contains the proctored
   exam.

#. For **Allowance Type**, select **Review Policy Exception**.

#. Add a description of the allowance, such as the following example.

   ``Learner cannot see. Allow an additional person in the room to act as a
   scribe.``

#. For **Username** or **Email**, enter the learner's information.

#. Select **Save**.

When you have set up the allowance, let the learner know that their special
allowance has been granted.

When the proctoring service reviews the learner’s proctored exam results, the
reviewer takes the special allowance into account.


.. _Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam:

******************************************
Allow Learners to Retake a Proctored Exam
******************************************

If a learner needs to retake a proctored exam, you can clear
their existing exam attempt and allow them to retake the exam.

The procedures for allowing learners to retake a proctored exam and a timed
exam are the same. To allow learners to retake an exam, see :ref:`Allow
Learners to Retake a Timed Exam`.
