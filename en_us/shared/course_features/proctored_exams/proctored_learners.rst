 The learner experience of a proctored exam depends on the proctoring service
 that your course or organization uses. Typically, learners can expect to
 download and install proctoring software, verify their identities, and use
 their webcams to scan the testing environment before they take the exam. For
 more information, see :ref:`openlearners:OE SFD Proctored Exams` in the *Open
 edX Learner's Guide*.

  You can create an ungraded practice proctored exam for your course so that
  learners can become familiar with the process of installing proctoring
  software and performing the required checks ahead of time. Learners complete
  the following steps for a practice proctored exam.

  * Install the proctoring software.
  * Complete identity checks.
  * Complete a room scan.
  * Complete any example problems in the exam.

  When you create a practice proctored exam, keep the following information in
  mind.

  * Proctoring software in practice proctored exams is available only to learners
    in a paid enrollment track (e.g. verified, Master's, Professional Certificate).
    Learners in other enrollment tracks will only see practice proctored exam content.
  * Practice proctored exam content is visible to all learners, regardless of
    enrollment track.
  * Practice exams do not affect credit eligibility and do not include
    monitoring by the proctoring software.
  * Learners who complete practice exams must complete the same software
    installation and environment scan steps again when they take an actual
    proctored exam.
