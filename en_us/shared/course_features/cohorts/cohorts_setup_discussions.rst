Setting up Discussions in Courses with Cohorts
######################################################

In courses that use cohorts, in addition to discussion topics that are by
default shared by all learners, you can create divided discussion topics, within
which learners interact only with other members of their cohort.

For information about divided discussions, see :ref:`About Divided
Discussions`.

For information about managing and moderating discussions, see :ref:`Managing
Divided Discussion Topics` and :ref:`Guidance for Discussion Moderators`.
