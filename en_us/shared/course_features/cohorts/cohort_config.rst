*********
Overview
*********

To use cohorts in your course, you must select a strategy for assigning
your learners to cohorts: automated assignment, manual assignment, or a hybrid
approach. For more information, see :ref:`Options for Assigning Learners to
Cohorts`.

.. note:: Although you can change the assignment method for cohorts at any
  time, you should have a strategy in mind as you design your course, and only
  make changes to cohorts while the course is running if absolutely necessary.

You must also decide whether course-wide and content-specific discussion topics
should be divided by cohort or unified for all learners.

After you decide on a cohort strategy for your course, complete these
configuration steps (as applicable).

#. :ref:`Enable cohorts<Enable Cohorts>`.

#. Determine the method you want to use to assign students to cohorts.

  * :ref:`Implement an automated assignment strategy<Implementing the Automated
    Assignment Strategy>`

  * :ref:`Implement a manual assignment strategy<Implementing the Manual
    Assignment Strategy>` and :ref:`manually assign enrolled learners <Assign
    Learners to Cohorts Manually>` to the cohorts that you create

  * :ref:`Use a combination of automated and manual assignment<Hybrid
    Assignment>`

3. Optionally, identify the discussion topics that you want to be divided by
   cohort.

   For information about divided discussions, see :ref:`About Divided
   Discussions`.

You complete these procedures on the **Cohorts** tab on the Instructor
Dashboard.

For an optimal learner experience, you should make sure that configuration of
the cohort feature is as complete as possible before the start date of your
course. If you need to make changes to the way you have configured cohorts
while your course is running, be aware of the implications of your changes. For
more information, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing an Automated Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement an automated assignment strategy of learners to cohorts, you
:ref:`enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>` for your course, and
:ref:`create cohorts<Add Cohorts>` that have the **Automatic**
:ref:`assignment method<Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort>`. To
add learners to these cohorts, you do not need to take any action: the
system automatically and randomly assigns learners to the available automatic
cohorts when they first access any course content or discussion on the
**Course** or **Discussion** pages. Learners who access the **Home** page or
other course pages such as a **Textbook** page do not receive a cohort
assignment until they view course content or discussions.

.. note:: You can :ref:`add learners manually<Assign Learners to Cohorts
   Manually>` to any cohort, whether it was created as an automated cohort or a
   manual cohort.

For a scenario using an automated assignment strategy, see :ref:`All Automated
Assignment`. For a scenario using a combination of automated and manual
assignment to cohorts, see :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

.. _About Auto Cohorts:

=================
Automated Cohorts
=================

The first time a learner views course content on the **Course** or
**Discussion** page, if she is not already assigned to a cohort, she is
randomly assigned to one of the automated cohorts. If no automated cohorts
exist, the system creates a :ref:`default cohort <Default Cohort Group>` and
assigns the learner to this cohort.

.. note:: The default cohort is created to ensure that every learner is
   assigned to a cohort. To avoid having to re-assign learners from the default
   cohort to other cohorts, make sure you create the automated cohorts that you
   want before the course starts.

.. _Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing a Manual Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement a manual assignment strategy of learners to cohorts, you
:ref:`enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>` for your course, and
:ref:`create cohorts<Add Cohorts>` that have the **Manual** :ref:`assignment
method<Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort>`. Then, you manually assign
enrolled learners to the appropriate cohorts.

.. note:: You can only add learners to a cohort manually if they have enrolled
   in your course.

Manual assignments should be as complete as possible before your course
starts. If learners enroll after your course starts, you should continue to
assign new learners to cohorts. If you need to make changes to the way you
have configured cohorts while your course is running, see :ref:`Altering
Cohort Configuration`.

For a scenario using a manual assignment strategy, see :ref:`All Manual
Assignment`. For a scenario using a combination of automated and manual
assignment to cohorts, see :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

.. _Enable Cohorts:

*********************************
Enabling Cohorts in your Course
*********************************

To enable cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Select **Enable Cohorts**.

You can now :ref:`add cohorts<Add Cohorts>` to your course.

.. warning:: Be very careful in deciding to enable the cohort feature in a live
   course, because doing so affects the course experience for learners.
   Learners might no longer have access to course and discussion topics
   that were previously visible to them.

   If you must make changes to cohort configuration while your course is
   running, be sure you understand the consequences of doing so. For details,
   see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Add Cohorts:

****************
Adding Cohorts
****************

After you enable the cohorts feature for your course, you can add cohorts. To
add a cohort to your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Click **Add Cohort**.

#. Enter a name for the cohort.

   .. note::
    Learners can see the name of the cohort they are assigned to. The message
    "This post is visible only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in
    discussion topics that are divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Group
    Indicator in Posts`.

#. Specify whether learners are automatically or manually assigned to this
   cohort.

#. Optionally, select **Select a Content Group** to associate the cohort with a
   :ref:`content group<About Content Groups>`. For information about creating
   cohort-specific course content by associating cohorts with content groups,
   see :ref:`Cohorted Courseware Overview`.

#. Select **Save**.

Continue implementing your cohort strategy by creating additional cohorts as
applicable, and specifying the assignment method for each cohort.

.. note:: When your course starts, you must have at least one cohort in your
   course that has automatic assignment. If you have not created at least one
   automated assignment cohort in the course by the time that the first learner
   accesses your course content, edX creates a default cohort to which learners
   are automatically assigned.

For details about adding learners to a cohort by uploading a .csv file, see
:ref:`Assign Learners to Cohort Groups by uploading CSV`.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled
learner, review the learner profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohorts, but you can change their names or the way
   in which learners are assigned to them. If you need to make changes to the
   way you have configured cohorts while your course is running, see
   :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually:

***********************************
Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually
***********************************

If you have implemented a manual assignment strategy for cohorts in your
course, make sure your manual assignments are as complete as possible before
your course starts. Making changes to cohort assignments after the course
starts affects the course experience for learners.

To manually assign learners to cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

.. note:: You can only add learners to a cohort manually if they have enrolled
   in your course.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort to which you want to
   manually assign students.

#. On the **Manage Students** tab, under **Add students to this cohort** enter
   the username or email address of a single student, or enter multiple
   usernames or addresses separated by commas or new lines. You can copy data
   from a .csv file of email addresses or usernames, and paste it into this
   field.

#. Select **Add Students**. The learners you added are assigned to the selected
   manual cohort. A message appears to indicate the number of learners who were
   added to the cohort. Because learners can belong to only one cohort, adding a
   learner to a cohort removes them from any cohort they were previously assigned
   to. Therefore, the message also indicates the number of learners whose
   assignment to another cohort was changed as a result of your adding them to
   another cohort using this procedure.

 .. note:: The number of learners reported on the **Cohorts** tab and in
    downloaded reports includes only those learners who are enrolled in the
    course.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled learner,
review the learner profile information for your course. See :ref:`View and
download student data`.

.. _Assign Learners to Cohort Groups by uploading CSV:

***************************************************
Assign Learners to Cohorts by Uploading a .csv File
***************************************************

Uploading a .csv file containing a list of learners and the cohorts that you
want to assign them to is another way of assigning learners to cohorts
manually. For details about the other manual assignment method, see
:ref:`Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually`.

.. note:: You can only add learners to a cohort using a .csv file if they have
   enrolled in your course.

Any assignments to cohorts that you specify in the .csv files you upload
will overwrite or change existing cohort assignments. The configuration of
your cohorts should be complete and stable before your course begins. You
should also complete manual cohort assignments as soon as possible after any
learner enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while your course is
running. To understand the effects of changing cohort assignments after your
course has started, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. note:: Be aware that the contents of the .csv file are processed row by row,
  from top to bottom, and each row is treated independently.

  For example, if your .csv file contains conflicting information such as
  Student A being first assigned to Cohort 1, then later in the spreadsheet
  being assigned to Cohort 2, the end result of your .csv upload is that
  Student A is assigned to Cohort 2. However, the upload results file will
  count Student A twice in the "Students Added" count: once when they are added
  to Cohort 1, and again when they are added to Cohort 2. Before submitting a
  file for upload, check it carefully for errors.

The requirements for the .csv file are summarized in this table.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Requirement**
      - **Notes**
    * - Valid .csv file

      - The file must be a properly formatted comma-separated values file:

        * The file extension is .csv.
        * Every row must have the same number of commas, whether or not there
          are values in each cell.
    * - File size
      - The file size of .csv files for upload is limited to a maximum of 2MB.
    * - UTF-8 encoded

      - You must save the file with UTF-8 encoding so that Unicode characters
        display correctly.

        See :ref:`Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File`.

    * - Header row
      - You must include a header row, with column names that exactly match
         those specified in "Columns" below.
    * - One or two columns identifying students
      - You must include at least one column identifying students:
        either "email" or "username", or both.

        If both the username and an email address are provided for a student,
        the email address has precedence.

        In other words, if an email address is present, an incorrect or non-
        matching username is ignored.

    * - One column identifying the cohort

      - You must include one column named "cohort" to identify the cohort
        to which you are assigning each student.

        The specified cohorts must already exist in Studio.

    * -
      - Columns with headings other than "email", "username" and "cohort" are
        ignored.


To manually add enrolled learners to cohorts by uploading a .csv file, follow
these steps.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio, select **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort to which you are adding
   students.

#. Select **Assign students to cohorts by uploading a CSV file**, then select
   **Browse** to navigate to the .csv file you want to upload.

#. Select **Upload File and Assign Students**. A status message is displayed
   above the **Browse** button.

#. Verify your upload results on the **Data Download** page.

   Under **Reports Available for Download**, locate the link to a .csv file
   with "cohort_results" and the date and time of your upload in the filename.
   The list of available reports is sorted chronologically, with the most
   recently generated files at the top.

The results file provides the following information:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Column**
      - **Description**
    * - Cohort
      - The name of the cohort to which you are assigning learners.
    * - Exists
      - Whether the cohort was found in the system. TRUE/FALSE.

        If the cohort was not found (value is FALSE), no action is taken for students you assigned to that cohort in the .csv file.

    * - Students Added
      - The number of learners added to the cohort during the row by row
        processing of the .csv file.
    * - Students Not Found
      - A list of email addresses or usernames (if email addresses were not
        supplied) of learners who could not be matched by either email address
        or username and who were therefore not added to the cohort.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled learner,
review the learner profile information for your course. See :ref:`View and
download student data`.

.. _Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File:

====================================
Creating a Unicode-encoded .csv File
====================================

Make sure the .csv files that you upload are encoded as UTF-8, so that any
Unicode characters are correctly saved and displayed.

.. note:: Some spreadsheet applications (for example, MS Excel) do not allow
   you to specify encoding when you save a spreadsheet as a .csv file. To
   ensure that you are able to create a .csv file that is UTF-8 encoded, use a
   spreadsheet application such as Google Sheets, LibreOffice, or Apache
   OpenOffice.

.. _Altering Cohort Configuration:

*************************************************
Altering Cohort Configuration in a Running Course
*************************************************

The configuration of cohorts should be complete and stable before your course
begins. Manual cohort assignments should be completed as soon as possible after
any learner enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while your course is
running.

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and activity in the course discussion begins, be sure that you understand the
consequences of these actions.

* :ref:`Renaming a Cohort`
* :ref:`Deleting a Cohort`
* :ref:`Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort`
* :ref:`Disabling the Cohort Feature`

.. _Changing Student Cohort Assignments:

***************************************************
Change Student Cohort Assignments
***************************************************

After your course starts and learners begin to contribute to the course
discussion, each post that they add is visible either to everyone or to the
members of a single cohort. When you change the cohort that a learner is
assigned to, there are three results.

* The learner continues to see the posts that are visible to everyone.

* The learner sees the posts that are visible to his new cohort.

* The learner no longer sees the posts that are visible only to his original
  cohort.

The visibility of a post and its responses and comments does not change, even
if the cohort assignment of its author changes. To a learner, it can seem that
posts have "disappeared".

To verify the cohort assignments for your learners, download the :ref:`student
profile report<View and download student data>` for your course. If changes are
needed, you can :ref:`assign learners<Assign Learners to Cohorts Manually>` to
different cohorts manually in the LMS by selecting **Instructor** and then
**Cohorts**, or :ref:`upload cohort assignment changes<Assign Learners to
Cohort Groups by uploading CSV>` in a .csv file.

.. _Renaming a Cohort:

***************
Rename a Cohort
***************

You can change the name of any cohort, including the system-created default
cohort.

To rename a cohort, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio select **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort whose name you want to
   change.

#. On the **Settings** tab, in the **Cohort Name** field, enter a new name for
   the cohort.

#. Select **Save**. The name for the cohort is updated throughout the LMS and
   the course, including learner-visible views.

.. _Deleting a Cohort:

================
Delete a Cohort
================

You cannot delete cohorts. However, you can :ref:`rename a cohort<Renaming a
Cohort>`, :ref:`change its assignment method<Changing the Assignment Method of
a Cohort>`, or move learners to other cohorts.

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and learners begin viewing the course and the discussion topics, be sure that
you understand the consequences of these actions. For more details, see
:ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort:

******************************************
Changing the Assignment Method of a Cohort
******************************************

Although you can change the assignment method of a cohort at any time after you
create it, you should have a strategy in mind as you design your course, and
only make changes to cohorts while the course is running if absolutely
necessary. Be aware of the implications of changing cohort configuration while
your course is running. For more information, see :ref:`Options for Assigning
Learners to Cohorts` and :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. note:: When your course starts, you must have at least one cohort in your
   course that has automatic assignment. If you have not created at least one
   automated assignment cohort in the course by the time that the first learner
   accesses your course content, edX creates a default cohort to which learners
   are automatically assigned. If the :ref:`default group<Default Cohort
   Group>` is the only automated assignment cohort in your course, you cannot
   change its assignment method to **Manual**.

To change the assignment method of a cohort, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio select **View
   Live**.

#. Select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. From the **Select a cohort** list, select the cohort whose assignment method
   you want to change.

#. On the **Settings** tab, the current assignment method is selected. Change
   the assignment method by selecting the other option, either **Automatic** or
   **Manual**.

#. Select **Save**.

   The cohort assignment method is updated.

.. note:: Changing the cohort assignment method has no effect on learners who
   are already assigned to this and other cohorts. Learners who access the
   course after you make this change are assigned to cohorts based on the new
   assignment method of this cohort combined with the assignment methods of all
   other cohorts.

.. _Disabling the Cohort Feature:

******************************
Disable Cohorts in Your Course
******************************

.. warning:: Be very careful in deciding to disable the cohort feature if you
   previously had it enabled in a live course, because doing so affects the
   course experience for learners. Course materials and discussion posts that
   were shared only with members of particular cohorts are now visible to all
   learners in the course.

   If you must make changes to the way you have configured cohorts while your
   course is running, be sure you understand the consequences of doing so. For
   details, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

To disable cohorts in your course, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select **Instructor**, then select **Cohorts**.

#. Clear the **Enable Cohorts** option.

All course content and discussion posts that were previously divided by cohort
immediately become visible to all students.
