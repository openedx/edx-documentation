######################################################################

The core mission of edX is to expand access to education for everyone. We
expect courses and course content developed on our platform to be accessible to
everyone, regardless of any physical limitation that they might have.

In furtherance of our mission, edX is committed to incorporating accessibility into
our website (http://www.edx.org), mobile applications, and platform (https://open.edx.org/) to meet a
wide variety of requirements of learners with disabilities and to enable
content providers to develop accessible course content.

The topics in this section are intended to help course teams understand how to
develop courses that can serve the widest possible audience.

.. note:: Course teams should familiarize themselves with this best practices
   guidance and distribute it to any members of their teams who are
   responsible for creating course content.
