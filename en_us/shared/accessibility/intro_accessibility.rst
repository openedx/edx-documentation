Accessibility Best Practices Guidance for Content Providers
######################################################################

The core mission of edX is to expand access to education for everyone. We
expect courses and course content developed on the Open edX platform to be
accessible to everyone, regardless of any physical limitation that they might
have.

.. Do not modify the following paragraph; wording exactly as provided by Legal.

In furtherance of our mission, edX has entered into an agreement with the
United States, under which we have agreed to incorporate accessibility into
our website (http://www.edx.org), mobile applications, and platform to meet a
wide variety of requirements of learners with disabilities and to enable
content providers to develop accessible course content.

The topics in this section are intended to help course teams understand how to
develop courses that can serve the widest possible audience.

.. note:: Course teams should familiarize themselves with this best practices
   guidance and distribute it to any members of their teams who are
   responsible for creating course content.
