Accessibility Best Practices for Developing Course Content
############################################################

EdX is dedicated to creating a platform that is not only itself accessible, but
also enables course content creators to create accessible content. If you
encounter platform issues that you believe might affect your ability to provide
accessible course content, please contact us at accessibility@edx.org. We
welcome any comments and questions.

.. note:: Use of authoring tools other than those provided by edX might result
   in inaccessible course content. However, for clarity, use of edX authoring
   tools does not ensure that your course content will be accessible.

.. _Make Sure Your Course Content is Perceivable:

************************************************
Make Sure Your Course Content is Perceivable
************************************************

The `WCAG 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#cc1>`_ guidelines are organized
around several principles, one of which is that web content must be
perceivable. That is, information and user interface components must be
presentable to users in ways they can perceive; it cannot be invisible to all
of their senses. In almost all cases, this means that the information should be
available as text, which can be rendered or transformed into a format that can
be perceived.

To produce content that is perceivable by all learners, follow these
guidelines.

=================================================
Include Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content
=================================================

For any non-text content, provide text alternatives so that the content can be
changed into other forms that people need, such as large print, braille,
speech, symbols, or simpler language.

For non-text tests or exercises that would be invalid if presented in text,
provide text alternatives that at least provide descriptions of the non-text
content. Make sure that all images have useful alternative text that screen
readers and other assistive technologies can read. For more information, see
:ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images`.

=================================================
Provide Alternatives for Time-Based Media
=================================================

For time-based media, including pre-recorded audio or video content, provide
alternative equivalent information, such as captions, audio description or
pre-recorded sign language interpretation. For more information, see
:ref:`Creating Accessible Media`.

=================================================
Make Sure Your Content is Adaptable
=================================================

Design your course content so that it can be presented in different ways
without losing information or structure. If your content includes specific
information, structure, and relationships (such as sequence) that is conveyed
through presentation, make sure the same information, structure, and
relationships can be programmatically determined or are available in text. HTML
is an ideal format in which to publish course content, because it provides
semantic elements with implied roles, states, and properties. Users of
assistive technologies rely on such semantic elements to effectively and
efficiently consume and navigate content. Publish your content in HTML whenever
possible.

Make sure your course content does not rely solely on sensory characteristics
such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound to be understood by
learners.

======================================================
Make It Easier for Learners to See and Hear Content
======================================================

Make the default presentation as easy to perceive as possible, especially by
making it easier for learners to distinguish foreground information from the
background, in both visual and audio elements.

For visual elements, techniques include making sure the fonts you use are
readable, and that there is sufficient contrast between the foreground and
background. Do not use color as the sole means of visually distinguishing an
element or conveying critical information. If you must create images that
contain text, make sure that the text has a font size of at least 14 points and
has good contrast with the background. Images of text cannot be scaled or
color corrected as effectively as HTML text. Whenever possible, use the default
font and color defined in the edX platform, which was designed to be easy to
read. If you choose to override default font colors, make sure that the
foreground and background colors have `sufficient contrast
<https://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/>`_.

For audio elements, make sure that foreground sounds are sufficiently louder
than background sounds.

.. _Make Sure Your Course Content is Understandable:

************************************************
Make Sure Your Course Content is Understandable
************************************************

Make sure your course content is readable and understandable. EdX courses have
a global and diverse audience, including learners whose native language is not
the language in which you created your course, as well as learners who have a
disability that affects reading, such as dyslexia or a visual impairment.

Learners will be better positioned to access concepts in your content if you
write in clear, straightforward language and the content is well structured.

=========================================
Write Simply and Clearly
=========================================

Avoid jargon. If unfamiliar words or phrases are relevant to the subject,
explain them when they are first used, and include a glossary with your course
materials. When you use an abbreviation or acronym, provide the full phrase the
first time it appears. For example, "World Health Organization (WHO)."

The Center for Plain Language provides `detailed resources on writing clearly
and concisely <http://centerforplainlanguage.org/5-steps-to-plain-language/>`_,
in language appropriate for your content and target audience.

=========================================
Make Your Course Easy to Navigate
=========================================

One aspect of making your course understandable is making sure that learners
can easily grasp its structure, find content, and determine where they are
within the course.

Name your course sections, subsections, units, components, and discussion
topics in a consistent way, and make sure the names are useful and easy to
skim. Make an element's name descriptive of its content, and put important
keyword information first in the name. These names are used in navigation
menus, page headings, and section headings; they are signposts that help
learners to navigate your course and read course content.

When you create written learning resources, break text into sections using
HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. Long blocks of unbroken
text are a barrier to most readers. Segmented content is more inviting and is
easier to navigate and search. See :ref:`Best Practices for HTML Markup` for
guidance on creating accessible HTML.

When you provide links to external materials, use link text that clearly
explains the link destination (for example, "Review the Course Syllabus").
Avoid using constructs such as "Review the Course Syllabus here", with only
the word "here" serving as link text. For links that point to documents rather
than web pages, include the document type in the link. For example,
"Supplemental Reading for Week 1 (EPUB)". Screen reader users frequently
browse lists of links, or navigate web pages by moving from one link to the
next. Ensuring that link text is understandable without surrounding context is
important.

.. _Best Practices for Describing Images:

************************************************
Use Best Practices for Describing Images
************************************************

When you use images (including diagrams, maps, charts, or icons) in your
course content, you must provide text alternatives that provide information
equivalent to the visual content, or that identify the purpose of such
non-text content.

The text alternative for an image depends on the image's context and purpose,
and might not be a simple description of the image's visual characteristics.
In general, for every image, edX recommends that you provide a text
alternative that provides the equivalent information that a sighted learner
would obtain from viewing the image. If the image contains words that are
important for understanding the content, include the words in the text
alternative. If the image itself is being used as a link, the text
alternative should describe the destination or action that will be performed
when the link is activated.

The primary mechanism for providing a text alternative for an image in HTML is
the ``alt`` attribute. The text value of this attribute is what screen reader
users hear when they encounter the image in your content.

.. note:: All images *must* include an ``alt`` attribute. There are some
   cases, noted below, when an empty ``alt`` attribute (``alt=""``) is
   desirable. However, the ``alt`` attribute must never be omitted.

Create useful and meaningful text alternatives for images in your course by
following these guidelines for particular situations.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

=========================================
Images That Are Links or Controls
=========================================

If your image serves as a link to additional content or is an interactive form
control such as a button, the value of the ``alt`` attribute should describe
the destination of the link or the action that will be performed when the user
clicks the image. For example, if a linked image of an envelope opens an email
program to send an email, a useful text alternative is "Send message", rather
than "Envelope."

===========================
Images That Contain Text
===========================

If your image contains text, the ``alt`` attribute would typically consist of
exactly the same text as is contained in the image. However, there are a
couple of conditions when having an empty ``alt`` attribute (``alt=""``) is
the preferred solution.

If the text contained in the image is also available in nearby HTML, or
otherwise accessible text, including it in the ``alt`` attribute would be
redundant. In this case, setting an empty ``alt`` attribute (``alt=""``) is
acceptable.  Doing so effectively "hides" the image from screen reader users.

.. note:: All images *must* include an ``alt`` attribute so do not omit
   the ``alt`` attribute entirely. If the ``alt`` attribute is omitted
   entirely, screen readers will read the value of the ``src`` attribute (the
   path to the image on a web server) as a fallback. This is rarely helpful to
   the user and often results in a poor user experience.

If the text contained in the image is for decorative purposes only and adds no
value to the content of the page, an empty ``alt`` attribute is also
acceptable.

===================================================================
Images That Contribute Meaning or Additional Context to the Page
===================================================================

If the image is a simple graphic or photograph that provides additional
context to the surrounding content, the ``alt`` attribute should briefly
describe the image in a way that conveys that context.

Consider the following examples of meaningful alt attributes for a photo of
the famous stone bridge, Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy.

* For a representative image of the bridge included on a page about Florence,
  a meaningful ``alt`` attribute would be "Photo of Ponte Vecchio, a famous
  bridge and shopping center in Florence, Italy."

* If the context of the page is about the bridge itself a meaningful ``alt``
  attribute would be more specific: "Photo of Ponte Vecchio showing its three
  stone arches which span the Arno River."

* For a technical diagram, or illustration, on a page about the construction of
  the bridge the ``alt`` attribute would include the details conveyed visually,
  such as dimensions and materials used: "The Ponte Vecchio is a stone bridge
  with three arches and a span-to-rise ratio of 5 to 1."

* For a map intended to provide directions to the bridge, the ``alt`` attribute
  would provide directions as text.

===========================================================
Graphs or Complex Visual Representations of Information
===========================================================

If the image is a graph or represents a complex piece of information, include
the information contained in the image as accessible text adjacent to the
image, or provide a link to the information. The ``alt`` attribute should
convey a summary of what the complex image conveys visually. For example, a
line graph that represents the price of a stock over time might be "The price
of the stock rises from $45 in January of 2015 to over $76 in June of 2015 with
a significant drop of 30% during the month of March."

Consider using a caption to display long descriptions so that the information
is available to all learners. In the following example, the image element
includes the short description as the ``alt`` attribute and the paragraph
element includes the long description.

  ``<img src="image.jpg" alt="Photo of Ponte Vecchio"> <p>Photo of Ponte Vecchio showing its three stone arches and the Arno river</p>``

Alternatively, provide long descriptions by creating an additional unit or
downloadable file that contains the descriptive text and providing a link to
the unit or file below the image.

  ``<img src="image.jpg" alt="Illustration of Ponte Vecchio"> <p><a href="description.html">Description of Ponte Vecchio Illustration</a></p>``

=============================================================
Images With Unknown Descriptions at The Time of Publication
=============================================================

If a suitable text alternative is unknown at the time of publication (for
example, a webcam image that updates every 10 minutes) provide an ``alt``
attribute that includes as much useful information as possible. For example,
"Traffic on Interstate 90 at 5:45 PM June 26, 2015."

===================================================
Non-Informative Images
===================================================

Images that do not provide information, including purely decorative images, do
not need text descriptions. For example, an icon that is followed by link text
that reads "Course Syllabus (EPUB)" does not need alternative text.

For non-informative images that should be skipped by screen reading software,
include an ``alt`` attribute but leave it with an empty value (also known as a
NULL ``alt`` attribute).

   ``<img src="image.jpg" alt="">``

.. note:: While it is appropriate to have an empty ``alt`` attribute, it is
  never acceptable to omit the ``alt`` attribute entirely. If image elements do
  not include an ``alt`` attribute at all, a screen reader will read the path
  to the image, or, in the case of a linked image, announce the linked URL.
  This is rarely helpful to the user and often results in a poor user
  experience.

.. _Information Graphics:

=============================================================
Information Graphics (Charts, Diagrams, Illustrations)
=============================================================

Graphics are helpful for communicating concepts and information, but they can
present challenges for people with visual impairments. For example, a chart
that requires color perception or a diagram with tiny labels and annotations
will likely be difficult to comprehend for learners with color blindness or low
vision. All images present a barrier to learners who are blind.

EdX recommends that you follow these best practices for making information
graphics accessible to visually impaired learners.

* Avoid using only color to distinguish important features of an image. For
  example, on a line graph, use a different symbol or line style as well as
  color to distinguish the data elements.

* Whenever possible, use an image format that supports scaling, such as .svg,
  so that learners can employ zooming or view the image larger. Consider
  providing a high-resolution version of complex graphics that have small but
  essential details.

* For every graphic, provide a text alternative that provides the equivalent
  information that a sighted learner would obtain from viewing the graphic. For
  charts and graphs, a text alternative could be a table displaying the same
  data. See :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images` for details about
  providing useful text alternatives for images.

  established by the US Department of Education (Office of Special Education
  Programs), provides guidance on ways to make it easier, faster, and more
  cost effective to create and use accessible images.

.. _Creating Accessible Course Materials:

************************************************
Create Accessible Course Materials
************************************************

The source teaching materials for your course might exist in a variety of
formats. For example, your syllabus might be in MS Word, your presentation
slides in MS PowerPoint, and your textbooks in publisher-supplied PDF. It is
important to consider how accessible these supplemental materials are before
making them available through your course.

Carefully consider the document format you choose for publishing your course
materials, because some formats support accessibility better than others.
Whenever possible, create course materials in HTML format, using the tools
available to you in edX Studio. When you make digital textbooks (ebooks)
available within your course, ask digital book publishers for books in either
`DAISY <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAISY_Digital_Talking_Book>`_ or `EPUB 3
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB#Version_3.0.1_.28current_version.29>`_
format, or both. Both of these digital book formats include unparalleled
support for accessibility. However, simply supporting accessibility does not
always mean a document will be accessible. When you source ebooks from third
parties, it helps to ask the right questions about accessibility.

* Can screen readers read the document text?
* Do images in the document include alternative text descriptions?
* Are all tables, charts, and math provided in an accessible format?
* Does all media include text equivalents?
* Does the document have navigational aids, such as a table of contents, index,
  headings, and bookmarks?

Natively accessible formats like those mentioned above might not always be
available options. Other popular document formats included in edX courses
include PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. Many of the same
accessibility techniques and principles that apply to authoring web content
apply to these document formats as well.

* Images must have descriptive text associated with them.
* Documents should be well structured.
* Information should be presented in a logical order.
* Hyperlinks should be meaningful and describe the destination.
* Tables should include properly defined column and row headers.
* Color combinations should be high contrast.

The information that follows provides some practical guidance to publishing
accessible course materials in popular formats.

=====================================================
Accessible Course Materials Resources
=====================================================

* `The DAISY Consortium <http://www.daisy.org>`_ is a global partnership of
  organizations that supports and helps to develop inclusive publishing
  standards.

* `The EPUB 3 format <http://www.idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html>`_
  is widely adopted as the format for digital books.

.. _Creating Accessible PDFs:

=====================================================
Creating Accessible PDF Documents
=====================================================

Not all ebooks are available in DAISY or EPUB 3 format. Portable Document
Format (PDF) is another common format for course materials, including textbooks
supplied by publishers. However, converting materials to PDF documents can
create accessibility barriers, particularly for learners with visual
impairments. Such learners rely on the semantic document structure inherently
available in HTML, DAISY, or EPUB 3 to understand and effectively navigate PDF
documents. For more information, see :ref:`HTML Markup Resources`).

Accessibility issues are very common in PDF files that were scanned from
printed sources or exported from a non-PDF document format. Scanned documents
are simply images of text. To make scanned documents accessible, you must
perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on these documents, and proofread
the resulting text for accuracy before embedding it within the PDF file. You
must also add semantic structure and other metadata (headings, links,
alternative content for images, and so on) to the embedded text.

When you export documents to PDF from other formats, it is important to ensure
that the source document contains all the required semantic structure and
metadata before exporting. Unfortunately, some applications do not include this
information when exporting and require the author to add or "tag" the document
manually using PDF editing software. You should carefully consider whether
exporting to PDF is necessary at all.

.. note:: `OpenOffice <https://www.openoffice.org/>`_ and `LibreOffice
   <https://www.libreoffice.org/>`_ will produce the best results when you
   export documents to PDF.

Best Practices for Authoring Accessible PDF Documents
*******************************************************

* Explicitly define the language of the document so that screen readers know
  what language they should use to parse the document.

* Explicitly set the document title. When you export a file to PDF format, the
  document title usually defaults to the file name, not a human readable title.

* Verify that all images have alternative content defined or are marked as
  decorative only.

* Verify that the PDF file is "tagged". Make sure the semantic structure from
  the source document has been correctly imported to the PDF file.

* Verify that a logical reading order is defined. This is especially important
  for documents that have atypical page layouts or structure.

* If your document includes tables, verify that table headers for rows and
  columns are properly defined.

.. note:: When you export Microsoft Office documents as PDF, use the **Save
   as PDF** option. Make sure the **Document Structure Tags for Accessibility**
   option is selected (consult your software documentation for more details).
   PDFs generated from Windows versions of MS Office might be more accessible
   than those generated from Mac OS versions of MS Office. If you are using Mac
   OS, we highly recommend exporting from OpenOffice or LibreOffice.

.. note:: When you export from OpenOffice or LibreOffice, use the **Export as
   PDF** option. Make sure the **Tagged PDF** option is selected.


Evaluating PDF Files for Accessibility
***************************************

EdX highly recommends using the tools available in Adobe Acrobat Pro (for
example, "Accessibility Checker") to evaluate your PDF files for accessibility.
Adobe Acrobat Pro also includes tools (for example, "Make Accessible") for
fixing most common accessibility issues.

Accessible PDF Resources
*******************************************************

* Microsoft provides detailed `guidance on generating accessible PDFs from

Creating Accessible Word Documents
=====================================================

Many of the same accessibility techniques and principles that apply to
authoring web content also apply to creating Word documents.

* Images must have `descriptive text <https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Creating-accessible-Word-documents-D9BF3683-87AC-47EA-B91A-78DCACB3C66D#__toc275414986>`_ associated with them.

* Documents should be `well structured <https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Creating-accessible-Word-documents-D9BF3683-87AC-47EA-B91A-78DCACB3C66D#__toc275414990>`_.

* `Hyperlinks should be meaningful <https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Creating-accessible-Word-documents-D9BF3683-87AC-47EA-B91A-78DCACB3C66D#__toc275414991>`_ and describe the destination.

* Tables should include `properly defined column and row headers <https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Creating-accessible-Word-documents-D9BF3683-87AC-47EA-B91A-78DCACB3C66D#__toc271197283>`_.

* Color combinations should be high contrast.

* Verify the accessibility of your document using `Microsoft's Accessibility

  issues-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US>`_.

In addition, follow these guidelines when you format Word documents.

* Keep formatting simple. Use headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and
  captions. Use tables for tabular data. Do not add unnecessary indents,
  rules, columns, blank lines, or typographic variation.

* Use standardized styles for formatting your text, such as Normal, Heading 1,
  and Heading 2, rather than manually formatting text using text styles and
  indents. Formatting text for its semantic meaning and not for its visual
  appearance allows users of assistive technology to consume and navigate
  documents effectively and efficiently.

To make your content accessible and comprehensible to learners who use screen
reading software, start in Outline view and include all of your content as
text. After completing the outline, add design elements and images, and use
the picture formatting options in MS PowerPoint to include detailed text
descriptions of images that convey useful information to learners who cannot
view the images. Use the **Home > Drawing > Arrange > Selection Pane** option
to view the reading order of objects on each slide. If the reading order is
not logical, change the order of the objects.

.. _Best Practices for Math Content:

************************************************
Use Best Practices for Mathematical Content
************************************************

Math in online courses can be challenging to deliver in a way that is
accessible to people with vision impairments. Non-scalable images of
mathematical content cannot be sufficiently enlarged or navigated by low-vision
users and are not accessible to blind users at all.

EdX uses `MathJax <https://www.mathjax.org>`_ to render math content in a
format that is clear, readable, and accessible to people who use screen
readers. MathJax works together with math notation such as LaTeX and MathML to
render mathematical equations as text instead of images. EdX recommends that
you use MathJax to author your math content. MathJax renders math in a variety
of formats on the client side, offering the end user the ability to consume
math content in their preferred format. EdX Studio supports authoring math
directly in LaTeX using the `LaTeX Source Compiler
<https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/creating_content/create_html_component.html#import-latex-code>`_ to transform LaTeX into MathJax.

.. _Best Practices for Custom Content Types:

************************************************
Use Best Practices for Custom Content Types
************************************************

Using different content types in your courses can significantly add to the
learning experience for your learners. This section covers how to design
several custom content types so that your course content is accessible to all
learners.

.. contents::
   :local:

.. _Simulations and Interactive Modules:

======================================================
Simulations and Interactive Modules
======================================================

Simulations, including animated or gamified content, can enhance the learning
experience. In particular, they benefit learners who might have difficulty
acquiring knowledge from reading and processing textual content alone. However,
simulations can also present some groups of learners with difficulties. To
minimize barriers to learning, consider the intended learning outcome of the
simulation. Is your goal to reinforce understanding that can also come from
textual content or a video lecture, or is it to convey new knowledge that other
course resources cannot cover? Providing alternative resources will help
mitigate the impact of any barriers.

Although you can design simulations to avoid many accessibility barriers, some
barriers, particularly in simulations supplied by third parties, might be
difficult or impossible to address for technical or pedagogic reasons.
Understanding the nature of these barriers can help you provide workarounds for
learners who are affected. Keep in mind that attempted workarounds for
simulations supplied by third parties might require the supplier's consent if
copyrighted material is involved. If you consider third party solutions, we
encourage you to evaluate them for accessibility. The easiest way to do this is
to contact the vendor and ask them about the accessibility of their product.

Consider the following questions when creating simulations, keeping in mind
that as the course creator, you enjoy considerable freedom in selecting course
objectives and outcomes. Additionally, if the visual components of a simulation
are so central to your course design, providing alternative text description
and other accommodations might not be practical or feasible.

* Does the simulation require vision to understand? If so, provide text
  describing the concepts that the simulation conveys.

* Is a computer mouse necessary to operate the simulation? If so, provide text
  describing the concepts that the simulation conveys.

* Does the simulation include flashing or flickering content that could trigger
  seizures?

  If so, and if this content is critical to the nature of the simulation, take
  these steps.

  * Do not make using the simulation a requirement for a graded assessment
    activity.

  * Provide a warning that the simulation contains flickering or flashing
    content.

.. _Online Exercises and Assessments:

======================================================
Online Exercises and Assessments
======================================================

For each activity or assessment that you design, consider any difficulties that
learners with disabilities might have in completing it, and consider using
multiple assessment options. Focus on activities that can be completed and
submitted by all learners.

Some learners take longer to read information and input responses, such as
learners with visual or mobility impairments and learners who need time to
comprehend the information. If an exercise has a time limit, consider whether
the allowed time is enough for all learners to respond. Advance planning might
help to reduce the number of learners requesting time extensions.

Some online exercise question types, such as the following examples, might be
difficult for learners who have vision or mobility impairments.

* Exercises requiring fine hand-eye coordination, such as image mapped input or
  drag and drop exercises, might present difficulties to learners who have
  limited mobility. Consider alternatives that do not require fine motor
  skills, unless, of course, such skills are necessary for effective
  participation in the course. For example, instead of a drag and drop exercise
  for mapping atoms to compounds, provide a checkbox or multiple choice
  exercise.

* Highly visual stimuli, such as word clouds, might not be accessible to
  learners who have visual impairments. Provide a text alternative that conveys
  the same information, such as an ordered list of words in the word cloud.

.. _Third Party Content:

======================================================
Third-Party Content
======================================================

If you include links to third-party content in your course, be mindful of the
accessibility of such resources. EdX recommends that you evaluate third-party
content prior to sharing it with learners.

You can use the eReader tool or :ref:`Add Files to a Course` to incorporate
third-party textbooks and other publications in PDF format into your course.
You can also incorporate such materials into your course in HTML format. See
:ref:`Creating Accessible PDFs` for guidance on working with third-party
supplied PDFs, and :ref:`Best Practices for HTML Markup` for guidance on
creating accessible HTML.

.. _Creating Accessible Media:

************************************************
Create Accessible Media
************************************************

Media-based course materials help to convey concepts and can bring course
information to life. We require all videos in edX courses to include timed text
captions in `SubRip (SRT) format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format>`_. The edX media
player displays caption files in an interactive sidebar that benefits a variety
of learners, including learners who are hard of hearing or whose native
language differs from the primary language of the media. This built-in
universal design mechanism enhances your course’s accessibility. When you
create your course, you need to factor in time and resources for creating timed
text captions.

=====================================================
Timed Text Captions
=====================================================

Timed text captions are essential to opening up a world of information for
persons with hearing loss or literacy needs by making the readable equivalent
of audio content available to them in a synchronized manner. Globally hearing
loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree. It causes disability
in 5% (360 to 538 million) and moderate to severe disability in 124 million
people.  Timed text captions also be helpful for learners whose native
languages are languages other than the primary language of the media or who
have cognitive conditions that benefit from visual. The edX media player
displays timed text captions as links in an interactive area adjacent to the
video, which allows all learners to navigate to a specific section of the video
by selecting some location within the caption text.

Text caption files start with the text version of a video's spoken content and
any non-spoken audio that is important to understanding the context of the
video, such as [BUZZER], [LAUGHTER], or [THUNDER]. If you created your video
using a script, you have a great start on creating the text caption file.
Simply review the recorded video and update the script as needed. Proper
editing should maintain both the original meaning, content, and essential
vocabulary. Text captions can be uploaded to YouTube along with the video to
create a timed text file in `SubRip (SRT) format
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format>`_. Otherwise,
you will need to create the timed text caption file yourself or engage someone
to do it. There are many companies that will create timed text captions
(captions that synchronize the text with the video using time codes) for a fee.
SRT files should be associated with video components in Studio. See
:ref:`Working with Video Components` for details on how to associate text
captions with videos.

If you choose to create your own timed text caption files yourself, you must
follow these guidelines.

* Each caption frame should not be on screen for less than three seconds.
* Each caption frame must not be on screen for less than two seconds.
* Each caption frame should not exceed more than 2 lines.
* Each caption frame must not exceed more than 3 lines.
* Each line should not exceed more than 32 characters
* All caption frames should be precisely time synched to the audio.
* When multiple speakers are present, it is sometimes helpful to identify who
  is speaking, especially when the video does not make this clear.
* Non-speech sounds like [MUSIC] or [LAUGHTER] should be added in square
  brackets.

=====================================================
Descriptions in Video
=====================================================

When you create video segments, consider how you will convey information to
learners who cannot see what is happening in a video. Actions that are only
visible on screen without any audible equivalent are not accessible to learners
who have visual impairments.

For many topics, you can fully cover concepts in the spoken presentation. If it
is practical to do so, you should audibly describe visual events as they happen
in the video. For example, if you are illustrating dropping a coin and a
feather together from a height, you should consider narrating your actions as
you perform them. Ask yourself if your video would make sense if the learner
were only listening to the audio content, for example while they were driving a
car.

=====================================================
Downloadable Transcripts
=====================================================

For both audio and video transcripts, consider including a text file that
learners can download and review using tools such as word processing, screen
reader, or literacy software. All learners can use transcripts of media-based
learning materials for study and review.

.. _Best Practices for HTML Markup:

************************************************
Use Best Practices for HTML Markup
************************************************

HTML is the best format for creating accessible content. It is well supported
and adaptable across browsers and devices. Also, the information in HTML
markup helps assistive technologies, such as screen reader software, to
provide information and functionality to people with vision impairments.

Most of the problem type templates in edX Studio conform to our recommended
best practices in terms of good HTML markup. You can manually add appropriate
HTML tagging even if it does not exist in the component template. Depending on
the type of component you are adding to your course in edX Studio, the raw
HTML data is available either automatically or by selecting the "Advanced
Editor" or "HTML" views.

Keep the following guidelines in mind when you create HTML content.

* Use HTML tags to describe the meaning of content, rather than changing its
  appearance. For example, you should tag a section title with the appropriate
  heading level (such as ``<h3>``) rather than making the text appear like
  a heading by applying visual elements such as bold text and a larger font
  size. Format list items into a list rather than using images of bullets or
  indents. Using HTML to describe your content's meaning is valuable for
  learners who use screen readers, which, for example, can read through all
  headings of a specific level or announce the number of items in a list.

* Use HTML heading levels in sequential order to represent the structure of a
  document. Well-structured headings help learners and screen reader users to
  navigate a page and efficiently find what they are looking for.

  In your :ref:`HTML<Working with HTML Components>` and
  :ref:`problem<Working with Problem Components>` components, be sure to apply
  only heading levels 3 through 6 to your content. Because the components
  that you add are part of a complete page, and heading levels 1 and 2 are
  already in use by other elements on the page, any text with a heading 1
  or 2 style within an HTML or problem component can interfere with the
  functionality of tools such as screen readers.

* Use HTML list elements to group related items and make content easier to skim
  and read. HTML offers three kinds of lists.

  *  Unordered lists, where the order of items is not important. Each item is
     marked with a bullet.

  *  Ordered lists, where the order of items is important. Each item is listed
     with a number.

  *  Definition lists, where each item is represented using term and
     description pairs (like a dictionary).

* Use table elements to format information that works best in a grid format,
  and include descriptive row and column headings. Tag row and column headers
  with the ``<th>`` element so screen readers can effectively describe the
  content in the table.

  information (WebAIM).

.. _Universal Design for Learning:

************************************************
Apply Universal Design for Learning
************************************************

Universal Design for Learning focuses on delivering courses in a format so that
as many of your learners as possible can successfully interact with the
learning resources and activities you provide them, without compromising on
pedagogic rigor and quality.

The principles of Universal Design for Learning can be summarized by the
following points.

#. Present information and content in various ways.
#. Provide more than one way for learners to express what they know.
#. Stimulate interest and motivation for learning.

Course teams can apply these principles in course design by following several
guidelines.

* Design resources and activities that can be accessed by learners in a variety
  of ways. For example, if there is a text component, provide the ability to
  enlarge the font size or change the text color. For images and diagrams,
  always provide an equivalent text description. For video, include text
  captions.

* Provide multiple ways for learners to engage with information and demonstrate
  their knowledge. This is particularly important to keep in mind as you design
  activities and assessments.

* Identify activities that require specific sensory or physical capability and
  for which it might be difficult or impossible to accommodate the
  accessibility needs of learners. For example, an activity that requires
  learners to identify objects by color might cause difficulties for learners
  with visual impairments. In these cases, consider whether there is a
  pedagogical justification for the activity being designed in that way. If
  there is a justification, communicate these requirements to prospective
  learners in the course description and establish a plan for responding to
  learners who encounter barriers. If there is no justification for the
  requirements, edX recommends that you redesign the learning activities to be
  more flexible and broadly accessible.
