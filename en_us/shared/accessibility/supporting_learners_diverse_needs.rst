Supporting Learners with Diverse Needs
#######################################

Almost one fifth of the world's population has some kind of disability. Online
courses can reduce many barriers to education for these learners by providing
access to courses from any location, at any time, and through the use of
assistive technologies.

EdX is dedicated to creating a platform that is not only itself accessible,
but also enables course content creators to create accessible content. If you
encounter platform issues that you believe might affect your ability to
provide accessible course content, please contact us at accessibility@edx.org.
We welcome any comments and questions. 

.. Do not modify wording of the following note. Exact wording is from Legal.

.. note:: Use of authoring tools other than those provided by edX might result
   in inaccessible course content. However, for clarity, use of edX authoring
   tools does not ensure that your course content will be accessible.


************************
Who Are Our Learners?
************************

In the following sections, we provide guidance on creating and delivering
course content that allows students to use built-in accessibility
functionality (such as text-to-speech and magnification features), assistive
technologies, and alternative formats. These practices consider learners with
diverse needs, such as those in the following list.

* Blind learners who use a screen reader, which reads page text aloud, or a
  Braille display device, which renders page text in refreshable Braille.

* Low-vision learners who use screen magnification software to enlarge or
  modify the contrast of text and other onscreen content.

* Learners with vision impairments, such as difficulty seeing in low-light
  conditions, who modify their browser or operating system to change
  background colors and text settings to make text easier to read.

* Learners with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, who use text-to-
  speech technology that reads page content aloud.

* Physically disabled learners who control their computers using switching
  devices, voice recognition software, or eye gaze-activated technology
  instead of mouse devices or keyboards.

* Learners who modify their operating system settings to make the mouse or
  keyboard easier to use.

* Learners with hearing impairments who cannot access audio content and need
  the equivalent information in an alternative format, such as captions.

Removing Barriers to Learning
*****************************

EdX highly recommends that you implement the best practices in this document
and in other resources. If you cannot easily address any of these barriers to
providing accessible course content, edX recommends that you consult with
resources at your organization such as Disability Services, or assistive
technology and accessibility specialists.

The following resources might also assist you in producing accessible course
content.

* `User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 1.0 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag.php#whatis>`_
* `Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php>`_
* `WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php>`_
* `WCAT2ICT <http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag2ict>`_
* `EPUB 3.0 <http://idpf.org/epub/30>`_
* `DAISY Consortium <http://www.daisy.org/>`_
* `MathJax <http://www.mathjax.org>`_
* `MathML <http://www.w3.org/Math/>`_

While your ability to support students in the MOOC context might be different
from supporting on-campus students, we encourage you to develop a plan to
respond to students who inform you of accessibility barriers to learning.
However, given the large numbers of learners enrolling in many of the courses,
you will quickly see how important it is to address accessibility concerns
when creating a course.
