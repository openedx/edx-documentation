Working with Problem Components
################################

This section covers the basics of problem components: what they look like to
you and your learners, and the options that every problem component has.

.. contents::
 :local:
 :depth: 1

For more information about individual problem types, see :ref:`Create
Exercises`.

******************************
Overview
******************************

The problem component allows you to add interactive, automatically
graded exercises to your course content. You can create many different
types of problems in Studio.

******************************
Graded Problems
******************************

All problems receive a point score, but, by default, problems do not count
toward a learner's grade.

To have problems to count toward the grade, change the assignment type of the
subsection that contains the problems. For more information, see :ref:`Set the
Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection`.

.. _Problem Learner View:

.. include:: ../../../shared/course_components/Section_learner_problem_view.rst

.. _Problem Studio View:

************************************
The Studio View of a Problem
************************************

The information that you specify for every problem component is saved in OLX
(Open Learning XML), edX's XML standard. However, for many problem components
Studio offers two different editing interfaces: the simple editor and the
advanced editor.

*  The simple editor allows you to edit problems visually, and you use
   markdown-style formatting indicators to identify elements such as the
   question and the correct answer. You do not need to know XML or OLX (open
   learning XML) to use this editor.

*  The advanced editor presents problems with their OLX markup elements and
   attributes. You can edit problems in the advanced editor as well.

You can switch from the simple editor to the advanced editor at any time by
selecting **Advanced Editor** from the simple editor's toolbar. However, after
you save a problem in the advanced editor, you cannot open it again in the
simple editor.

.. _Simple Editor:

=================
The Simple Editor
=================

When you add one of these standard CAPA (computer assisted personalized
approach) problem types, the simple editor opens with a preformatted example
problem.

.. change to ...preformatted template.

*  :ref:`Checkbox`

*  :ref:`Dropdown`

*  :ref:`Multiple Choice`

*  :ref:`Numerical Input`

*  :ref:`Text Input`

The following image shows an example multiple choice problem in the simple
editor.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/MultipleChoice_SimpleEditor.png
 :alt: An example multiple choice problem in the simple editor with numbered
     callouts that demonstrate the markdown formatting.
 :width: 600

The simple editor includes a toolbar with options that provide the required
formatting for different types of problems. When you select an option from the
toolbar, formatted sample text appears in the simple editor. Alternatively,
you can apply formatting to your own text by selecting the text and then one
of the toolbar options.

Descriptions of the toolbar options follow.

#. **Heading**: Formats text as a title or heading.

#. **Multiple Choice**: Identifies text as an answer option for a multiple
   choice problem.

#. **Checkboxes**: Identifies text as an answer option for a checkboxes
   problem.

#. **Text Input**: Identifies text as the correct answer for a text input
   problem.

#. **Numerical Input**: Identifies the correct answer, with an optional
   tolerance, for a numerical input problem.

#. **Dropdown**: Identifies a comma-separated list as correct and incorrect
   answer options for a dropdown problem.

#. **Explanation**: Formats text as an explanation that appears after learners
   select **Show Answer**.

#. Opens the problem in the advanced editor.

#. Opens a list of formatting hints.

#. **Accessible Label**: Identifies the part of the problem text that is the
   specific question that learners will answer by selecting the options that
   follow, or by entering a text or numeric response. The toolbar does not have
   an option that provides this formatting, so you type two angle brackets on
   either side of the question text pointing inward. For example, ``>>Is this
   the question text?<<``.

   * Screen readers read all of the text that you supply for the problem, and
     then repeat the text that you identify with this formatting immediately
     before reading the answer choices for the problem.

   * The :ref:`Student_Answer_Distribution` report uses the text with this
     formatting to identify each problem.

   * Insights also uses the text with this formatting to identify each problem.
     For more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

.. _Advanced Editor:

===================
The Advanced Editor
===================

The advanced editor shows the OLX markup for a problem. Templates for some
problem types, such as math expression input, open directly in the advanced
editor.

The following image shows the multiple choice problem above in the advanced
editor instead of the simple editor.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/MultipleChoice_AdvancedEditor.png
 :alt: An image of a problem in the advanced editor.
 :width: 600

The following problem templates open in the advanced editor.

* :ref:`Circuit Schematic Builder` In circuit schematic problems, learners
  create and modify circuits on an interactive grid and submit computer-
  generated analyses of the circuits for grading.

* :ref:`Custom JavaScript` With custom JavaScript problems, you can create a
  custom problem or tool that uses JavaScript and add it directly into Studio.

* :ref:`Drag and Drop` Drag and drop problems require learners to drag text or
  objects to a specific location on an image.

* :ref:`Image Mapped Input` Image mapped input problems require learners to
  select a specific location on an image.

* :ref:`Math Expression Input` Math expression input problems require learners
  to enter a mathematical expression as text, such as e=m\*c^2.

* :ref:`Problem with Adaptive Hint` These problems can give learners feedback
  or hints based on their responses. Problems with adaptive hints can be text
  input or multiple choice problems.

* :ref:`Problem Written in LaTeX` This problem type allows you to convert
  problems that you previously wrote in LaTeX into the edX format. Note that
  this problem type is a prototype, and is not supported.

* :ref:`Write Your Own Grader` Custom Python-evaluated input (also called
  "write-your-own-grader" problems evaluate learners' responses using an
  embedded Python script that you create. These problems can be of any type.

.. _Problem Settings:

******************
Problem Settings
******************

In addition to the text of the problem, problems that you create using a
problem component have the following settings. To access these settings you
select **Settings** in the component editor.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

===============
Display Name
===============

This setting indicates the name of your problem. This name appears as a heading
above the problem in the LMS, and it identifies the problem for you in
Insights.

The following illustration shows the display name of a problem in Studio, in
the LMS, and in Insights.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/display_names_problem.png
 :alt: The identifying display name for a problem in Studio, the LMS, and
     Insights.
 :width: 800

Unique, descriptive display names help you and your learners identify problems
quickly and accurately. If you delete the default display name and do not enter
your own identifying name, the platform supplies "problem" for you.


For more information about metrics for your course's problem components, see
`Using edX Insights`_.

==============================
Maximum Attempts
==============================

This setting specifies the number of times that a learner is allowed to attempt
answering a problem. By default, the course-wide **Maximum Attempts**
advanced setting is null, meaning that the maximum number of attempts for
problems is unlimited. If the course-wide **Maximum Attempts** setting is
changed to a specific number, the **Maximum Attempts** setting for individual
problems defaults to that number, and cannot be set to unlimited.

.. note:: edX recommends setting **Maximum Attempts** to either unlimited or a
   very large number. Unlimited attempts allow for mastery learning and
   encourages risk taking and experimentation, both of which lead to improved
   learning outcomes. Allowing for unlimited attempts might be impossible in
   some courses, such as those where grading is primarily based on multiple
   choice problems.

.. note:: Only problems that have a **Maximum Attempts** setting of 1 or
   higher are included in the answer distribution computations used in edX
   Insights and the Student Answer Distribution report.

.. _Problem Weight:

==============================
Problem Weight
==============================

.. note:: The LMS stores scores for all problems, but
  scores only count toward a learner's final grade if they are in a subsection
  that is graded.

This setting specifies the total number of points possible for the
problem. The problem weight appears next to the problem's display name.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/ProblemWeight_DD.png
 :alt: An image of a problem from a learner's point of view, with the possible
       number of points, 3, circled.
 :width: 500

By default, each response field, or "answer space", in a problem component is
worth one point. Any problem component can have multiple response fields. For
example, the problem component above contains one dropdown problem that has
three separate questions, and also has three response fields.

You can increase or decrease the weight for a problem component by entering a
**Problem Weight**.

Computing Scores
****************

The score that a learner earns for a problem is the result of the
following formula.

**Score = Weight × (Correct answers / Response fields)**

*  **Score** is the point score that the learner receives.

*  **Weight** is the problem's maximum possible point score.

*  **Correct answers** is the number of response fields that contain correct
   answers.

*  **Response fields** is the total number of response fields in the problem.

**Examples**

The following are some examples of computing scores.

*Example 1*

A problem's **Weight** setting is left blank. The problem has two
response fields. Because the problem has two response fields, the
maximum score is 2.0 points.

If one response field contains a correct answer and the other response
field contains an incorrect answer, the learner's score is 1.0 out of 2
points.

*Example 2*

A problem's weight is set to 12. The problem has three response fields.

If a learner's response includes two correct answers and one incorrect
answer, the learner's score is 8.0 out of 12 points.

*Example 3*

A problem's weight is set to 2. The problem has four response fields.

If a learner's response contains one correct answer and three incorrect
answers, the learner's score is 0.5 out of 2 points.

.. _Randomization:

===============
Randomization
===============

.. note:: The **Randomization** setting serves a different purpose from
 "problem randomization". The **Randomization** setting affects how numeric
 values are randomized within a single problem and requires the inclusion of a
 Python script. Problem randomization offers different problems or problem
 versions to different learners. For more information, see :ref:`Problem
 Randomization`.

For problems that include a Python script to generate numbers randomly, this
setting specifies how frequently the values in the problem change: each time a
different learner accesses the problem, each time a single learner tries to
answer the problem, both, or never.

.. note:: This setting should only be set to an option other than **Never**
 for problems that are configured to do random number generation.

For example, in this problem, the highlighted values change each time a learner
submits an answer to the problem.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/Rerandomize.png
 :alt: An image of the same problem shown twice, with color highlighting on
   values that change.
 :width: 800

If you want to randomize numeric values in a problem, you complete both of
these steps.

* Make sure that you edit your problem to include a Python script that randomly
  generates numbers.

* Select an option other than **Never** for the **Randomization** setting.

..  For more information, see :ref:`Use Randomization in a Numerical Input Problem`.
..  ^^ add back to first bullet when DOC-2175 gets done - Alison 30 Jul 15

The edX Platform has a 20-seed maximum for randomization. This means that
learners see up to 20 different problem variants for every problem that has
**Randomization** set to an option other than **Never**. It also means that
every answer for the 20 different variants is reported by the Answer
Distribution report and edX Insights. Limiting the number of variants to a
maximum of 20 allows for better analysis of learner submissions by allowing you
to detect common incorrect answers and usage patterns for such answers.

For more information, see :ref:`Student_Answer_Distribution` in this guide, or
`Review Answers to Graded Problems`_ or `Review Answers to Ungraded Problems`_
in *Using edX Insights*.

.. important:: Whenever you choose an option other than **Never** for a
 problem, the computations for the Answer Distribution report and edX Insights
 include up to 20 variants for the problem, even if the problem was not
 actually configured to include randomly generated values. This can make data
 collected for problems that cannot include randomly generated values,
 (including, but not limited to, all multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown, and
 text input problems), extremely difficult to interpret.

You can choose the following options for the **Randomization** setting.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Option
     - Description
   * - **Always**
     - Learners see a different version of the problem each time they select
       Check.
   * - **On Reset**
     - Learners see a different version of the problem each time they select
       Reset.
   * - **Never**
     - All learners see the same version of the problem. For most courses, this
       option is supplied by default. Select this option for every problem in
       your course that does not include a Python script to generate random
       numbers.
   * - **Per Student**
     - Individual learners see the same version of the problem each time they
       look at it, but that version is different from the version that other
       learners see.

.. _Show Answer:

===============
Show Answer
===============

This setting defines when learners are shown the answers to a problem and has
the following options.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 70

   * - **Always**
     - Always show the answer when the learner selects the **Show Answer**
       button.
   * - **Answered**
     - Show the answer after the learner tries to answer the problem.

       If the problem can be, and is, reset, the answer is not shown until the
       learner tries the problem again. (When a learner answers a problem, the
       problem is considered to be both attempted and answered. When the
       problem is reset, the problem is still attempted, but not yet
       answered.)
   * - **Attempted**
     - Show the answer after the learner tries to answer the problem.

       If the problem can be, and is, reset, the answer continues to show.
       (When a learner answers a problem, the problem is considered to be
       both attempted and answered. When the problem is reset, the problem is
       still attempted, but not yet answered.)
   * - **Closed**
     - Show the answer after the learner has used up all his attempts to answer
       the problem or the due date has passed.
   * - **Finished**
     - Show the answer after the learner has answered the problem correctly,
       the learner has no attempts remaining, or the problem due date has
       passed.
   * - **Correct or Past Due**
     - Show the answer after the learner has answered the problem correctly or
       the problem due date has passed.
   * - **Past Due**
     - Show the answer after the due date for the problem has passed.
   * - **Never**
     - Never show the answer. In this case, a **Show Answer** button does not
       appear next to the problem in Studio or in the LMS.

.. _Show Reset Button:

=================
Show Reset Button
=================

This setting defines whether a **Reset** button is visible on the problem.

Learners can select **Reset** to clear any input that has not yet been
submitted, and try again to answer the problem.

If the learner has already submitted an answer, selecting **Reset** clears the
submission and, if the problem contains randomized variables and randomization
is set to **On Reset**, changes the values in the problem.

If the number of Maximum Attempts that was set for this problem has been
reached, the **Reset** button is not visible.

This problem-level setting overrides the course-level **Show Reset Button for
Problems** setting.

.. _Timer Between Attempts:

=======================
Timer Between Attempts
=======================

This setting specifies the number of seconds that a learner must wait between
submissions for a problem that allows multiple attempts. If the value is 0, the
learner can attempt the problem again immediately after an incorrect attempt.

Adding required wait time between attempts can help to prevent learners from
simply guessing when multiple attempts are allowed.

If a learner attempts a problem again before the required time has elapsed, she
sees a message below the problem indicating the remaining wait time. The format
of the message is, "You must wait at least {n} seconds between submissions. {n}
seconds remaining."


.. _Modifying a Released Problem:

*********************************
Modifying a Released Problem
*********************************

.. warning:: Be careful when you modify problems after they have been
 released. Changes that you make to published problems can affect the learner
 experience in the course and analysis of course data.

After a learner submits a response to a problem, the LMS stores that response,
the score that the learner received, and the maximum score for the problem. For
problems with a **Maximum Attempts** setting greater than one, the LMS updates
these values each time the learner submits a new response to a problem.
However, if you change a problem or its attributes, existing learner
information for that problem is not automatically updated.

For example, you release a problem and specify that its answer is 3.
After some learner have submitted responses, you notice that the answer
should be 2 instead of 3. When you update the problem with the correct
answer, the LMS does not update scores for learners who originally answered
2 for the problem and received the wrong score.

For another example, you change the number of response fields to
three. Learners who submitted answers before the change have a score of
0, 1, or 2 out of 2.0 for that problem. Learners who submitted answers
after the change have scores of 0, 1, 2, or 3 out of 3.0 for the same
problem.

If you change the weight setting for the problem in Studio, however, existing
scores update when the learner's **Progress** page is refreshed. In a live
section, learners will see the effect of these changes.

===============
Workarounds
===============

If you have to modify a released problem in a way that affects grading, you
have two options to ensure that every learner has the opportunity
to submit a new response and be regraded. Note that both options require you to
ask your learners to go back and resubmit answers to a problem.

*  In the problem component that you changed, increase the number of attempts
   for the problem, then ask all your learners to redo the problem.

*  Delete the entire problem component in Studio and create a new Problem
   component with the content and settings that you want, then ask all your
   learners to complete the new problem. (If the revisions you must make are
   minor, duplicate the problem component before you delete it and revise the
   copy.)

For information about how to review and adjust learner grades in the LMS, see
:ref:`Grades`.

.. _Multiple Problems in One Component:

***********************************
Multiple Problems in One Component
***********************************

You might want to create a problem that has more than one response type. For
example, you might want to create a numerical input problem and then include a
multiple choice problem about that numerical input problem. Or, you might
want a learner to be able to check the answers to many problems at one time. To
do this, you can include multiple problems inside a single problem component.
The problems can be different types.

.. note::
  You cannot use a :ref:`Custom JavaScript` in a component that contains more
  than one problem. Each custom JavaScript problem must be in its own
  component.

To create multiple problems in one component, create a new Blank Advanced
problem component, and then add the OLX  for each problem in the component
editor. You only need to include the OLX  for the problem and its answers. You
do not have to include the code for other elements, such as the **Check**
button.

Elements such as the **Check**, **Show Answer**, and **Reset** buttons, as well
as the settings that you select for the problem component, apply to all of the
problems in that component. Thus, if you set the maximum number of attempts to
3, the learner has three attempts to answer the entire set of problems in the
component as a whole rather than three attempts to answer each problem
individually. If a learner selects **Check**, the LMS scores all of the
problems in the component at once. If a learner selects **Show Answer**, the
answers for all the problems in the component appear.

.. _Problem Randomization:

***********************************
Problem Randomization
***********************************

Presenting different learners with different problems or with different
versions of the same problem is referred to as "problem randomization".

You can provide different learners with different problems by using randomized
content blocks, which randomly draw problems from pools of problems stored in
content libraries. For more information, see :ref:`Randomized Content Blocks`.

.. note:: Problem randomization is different from the **Randomization** setting
   in Studio. Problem randomization offers different problems or problem
   versions to different learners, whereas the **Randomization** setting
   controls when a Python script randomizes the variables within a single
   problem. For more information about the **Randomization** setting, see
   :ref:`Randomization`.



============================================
Course Outline Terminology in Exported Files
============================================

Sections, subsections, units, and components have different names in the
**Course Outline** view and in the list of files that you will see after you
export your course and open the OLX files for editing. The following table
lists the names of these elements in the **Course Outline** view and in a list
of files.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15
   :header-rows: 0

   * - Course Outline View
     - File List
   * - Section
     - Chapter
   * - Subsection
     - Sequential
   * - Unit
     - Vertical
   * - Component
     - Discussion, HTML, problem, or video

For example, when you want to find a specific section in your course, look in
the **Chapter** directory when you open the list of files that your course
contains. To find a unit, look in the **Vertical** directory.

.. _Create Randomized Problems:

==========================
Create Randomized Problems
==========================

.. note:: Creating randomized problems by exporting your course and editing
   some of your course's OLX files is no longer supported.

You can provide different learners with different problems by using randomized
content blocks, which randomly draw problems from pools of problems stored in
content libraries. For more information, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Randomized Content Blocks`.
