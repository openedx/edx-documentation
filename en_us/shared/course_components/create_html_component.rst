***********************
HTML Component Overview
***********************

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to
create web pages. Web browsers present HTML code in a more readable format.

When students see text and images in your course, they are seeing HTML code
that is formatted and presented by their browsers. For more information about
HTML, see `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_.

===================
HTML Components
===================

HTML components are the basic building blocks of your course content. You use
HTML components to add and format text, links, images, and more. You can work
with your HTML components in a "visual" or WYSIWYG editor that hides the HTML
code details, or in a "raw" editor that requires you to mark up your content.

.. note::
 Review :ref:`Developing Your Course Index` and :ref:`Best Practices for HTML
 Markup` before you start working with HTML components.

To add an instant hangout to an HTML component, see :ref:`Google Instant
Hangout`.

.. _Options for Editing HTML Components:

********************************************
Options for Editing HTML Components
********************************************

You can use two different editing interfaces to work with an HTML component.

* :ref:`The Visual Editor`

  With the visual editor you create, edit, and format content in a word
  processing-like interface, without using HTML markup directly. With the
  visual editor, you can more easily format your content, and add links and
  images. The visual editor includes an **HTML** option for you to review the
  HTML markup and make small formatting changes to your content. However, this
  HTML option does not provide the detailed control you can get with the raw
  HTML editor, and does not support custom formatting or scripts.

  If you add an HTML component and select **Text**, when you select **Edit**
  the visual editor opens by default.

* :ref:`The Raw HTML Editor`

  If you prefer to mark up your content directly with HTML markup, you can use
  the raw HTML editor. If you need to include custom formatting or scripts in
  your content, you must use the raw HTML editor.

  If you add an HTML component and select **Raw HTML**, when you select
  **Edit** the raw HTML editor opens by default.

You can switch back and forth between these two editing interfaces at any time.
For more information, see :ref:`Set the Editor for an HTML Component`.

.. note::
    If you copy text from another source and paste it into either the visual or
    raw HTML editor, be sure to proofread the result carefully. Some
    applications automatically change quotation marks and apostrophes from the
    "straight" version to the "smart" or "curly" version. Both editors require
    "straight" quotation marks and apostrophes.

.. _Set the Editor for an HTML Component:

======================================
Set the Editor for an HTML Component
======================================

#. Add or locate the HTML component in your course.

#. Select **Edit**, and then select **Settings**.

#. Select **Visual** or **Raw**.

#. Select **Save**, and then reopen the component to use the new editor.

.. warning::
 If you work with content in the raw HTML editor, then switch to the visual
 editor, custom HTML can be lost. If you need to create custom HTML, edX
 recommends that you start by using the visual editor, and then switch to the
 raw HTML editor when you are ready to add the custom HTML.

.. _The Visual Editor:

*****************************************
The Visual Editor
*****************************************

The visual editor provides a "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) interface
that allows you to format text by selecting options at the top
of the editor.

The following image shows callouts for the editing options and is followed by
descriptions.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_VisualView_Toolbar.png
  :alt: An image of the visual editor toolbar, with numbers next to each of the
   formatting buttons.
  :width: 600

#. Choose a formatting style for the selected text, such as paragraph,
   ``preformatted`` (monospace), or a heading level. The heading levels
   available for an HTML component begin with Heading 3. Because HTML
   components are part of a complete page, and heading levels 1 and 2 are in
   use by other elements on the page, any text with a heading 1 or 2 style
   within an HTML component can interfere with the functionality of tools such
   as screen readers.

#. Choose a font family for selected text, such as Arial, Courier New, or Times
   New Roman.

#. Format the selected text in bold, or remove bolding. The editor inserts
   ``<strong>`` tags around the selected text.

#. Format the selected text in italics, or remove italicization. The editor
   inserts ``<em>`` tags around the selected text.

#. Underline the selected text, or remove underlining. The editor encloses the
   selected text in the tag ``<span style="text-decoration: underline;">``.

#. Apply a color to the selected text. The editor encloses the selected text in
   the tag ``<span style="color: color-hex-code;">``.

#. Format the selected text as a code block, or remove this formatting. The
   editor inserts ``<code>`` tags around the selected text, which is then
   displayed in a monospace font.

#. Create a bulleted list, or remove this formatting. The editor inserts
   ``<ul>`` tags around the selected text, and encloses each paragraph in
   ``<li>`` tags.

#. Create a numbered list, or remove this formatting. The editor inserts
   ``<ol>`` tags around the selected text, and encloses each paragraph in
   ``<li>`` tags.

#. Decrease and increased the indentation of the selected paragraph.

#. Format the selected paragraph as a blockquote. The editor inserts
   ``<blockquote>`` tags around the selected text, which is then displayed as a
   separate paragraph in a monospace font.

#. Create a hypertext link from the selected text. See :ref:`Add a Link in an
   HTML Component`.

#. Remove a hypertext link from the selected text.

#. Insert an image at the cursor. See :ref:`Add an Image to an HTML Component`.

#. Review the HTML markup.

.. note::
  The visual editor is not available for :ref:`course handouts <Adding Course
  Updates and Handouts>`.

.. _Work with HTML code:

=========================================
Review HTML Markup in the Visual Editor
=========================================

To review the HTML markup added to  content in the visual editor, select
**HTML** from the visual editor's toolbar. The HTML source code editor opens.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_source_code.png
 :alt: The HTML source code editor for the visual editor in Studio.
 :width: 600

You can edit text and the HTML markup in this editor. However, you cannot add
custom styles or scripts in this editor. Use the
:ref:`raw HTML editor<The Raw HTML Editor>` instead.

Select **OK** to return to the visual editor. The visual editor attempts to
correct any problems with the markup that you entered. For example, if you do
not provide a close paragraph tag, the editor adds the tag for you.

You can then continue working in the visual editor.

.. warning::
 Selecting **OK** in the source code editor does not save your changes to the
 HTML component. To save your changes and close the component, select **Save**
 in the visual editor. If you select **Cancel**, the changes you made in the
 HTML source code editor are discarded.

.. _The Raw HTML Editor:

*****************************
The Raw HTML Editor
*****************************

The raw HTML editor is a text editor. It does not offer a toolbar with
formatting options.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/raw_html_editor.png
 :alt: The raw HTML editor.
 :width: 600

When you use this editor, you must supply valid HTML. The raw HTML editor does
not validate your HTML code. If you use this editor, you should thoroughly test
the HTML content in your course.

.. important:: Because HTML components are part of a complete page, any
   text with a heading 1 or 2 style within an HTML component can interfere
   with the functionality of tools such as screen readers. Be sure that the
   headings you add to an HTML component are Heading 3 ``<h3>`` through Heading
   6 ``<h6>``, and not ``<h1>`` or ``<h2>``.

.. _HTML Component Templates:

*****************************
HTML Component Templates
*****************************

When you create an HTML component, you select from a list of templates.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/html_templates.png
 :alt: The list of HTML Component templates in the Studio unit page.
 :width: 200

The raw HTML template uses the raw HTML editor by default. All of the other
templates use the visual editor by default. You can switch between the editors
in any HTML component. For more information, see :ref:`Set the Editor for an
HTML Component`.

.. _Create an HTML Component:

*****************************
Create an HTML Component
*****************************

#. Under **Add New Component**, select **HTML**.

#. Select the template.

   The rest of these instructions assume that you selected **Text**, which
   creates an empty HTML component with the :ref:`visual editor<The Visual
   Editor>` selected.

   An empty HTML component appears at the bottom of the unit.

#. In the component, select **Edit**.

   The HTML component opens in the visual editor.

#. Enter and format your content. You can :ref:`review the HTML markup<Work
   with HTML code>` if needed.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTMLEditor.png
    :alt: An image of the HTML component in the visual editor.
    :width: 600

#. Enter a display name for the component. The display name identifies the
   component for learners, so it should describe the content effectively. To
   do so, select **Settings**, and then enter text in the **Display Name**
   field.

   To return to the visual editor, select **Editor**.

#. Select **Save**.

When using the visual editor, you can also perform the following tasks.

* :ref:`Add a Link in an HTML Component`
* :ref:`Add an Image to an HTML Component`
* :ref:`Import LaTeX Code`

.. _Add a Link in an HTML Component:

***********************************
Add a Link in an HTML Component
***********************************

When using the visual editor, to add a link to a website, course unit, or file
in an HTML component, you work with the **Insert link** dialog box.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-EditLink_DBox.png
 :alt: An image of the Insert link dialog box used in an HTML component.
 :width: 400

For more information, see the following tasks.

* :ref:`Add a Link to a Website`
* :ref:`Add a Link to a Course Unit`
* :ref:`Add a Link to a File`

.. _Add a Link to a Website:

=========================================
Add a Link to a Website
=========================================

#. Select the text that you want to use as the link text.

#. Select the link icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert link** dialog box, enter the URL of the website that is the
   destination for your link.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-EditLink_Website.png
    :alt: An image of of the Insert link dialog box with a link to edx.org and
     the link text edX Website.
    :width: 400

#. If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown arrow
   next to the **Target** field, and then select **New Window**. If not, you
   can leave the default value.

#. Select **OK**.

#. Save the HTML component.

#. To test the link, select **View Live Version** or **Preview**. When the unit
   opens in the LMS, select the linked text and verify that the correct website
   opens.

.. _Add a Link to a Course Unit:

=========================================
Add a Link to a Course Unit
=========================================

.. note:: To link to another component, the unit of that destination component
  must be published for the link to work.

#. Obtain the unit identifier of the unit you want to link to. To do this, open
   the unit page in Studio, and copy the unit ID from the **Unit Identifier**
   field under **Unit Location** in the right pane.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/UnitIdentifier.png
    :alt: An image of the unit page with the unit identifier circled.
    :width: 600

#. Open the HTML component where you want to add the link.

#. Select the text that you want to make into the link.

#. Select the link icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert link** dialog box, enter the following in the **URL** field.

   ``/jump_to_id/<unit identifier>``

   Make sure to replace <unit identifier> (including the brackets) with the
   unit identifier that you copied in step 1, and make sure to include both
   forward slashes (/).

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-EditLink_CourseUnit.png
    :alt: An image of the Insert link dialog box with a link to a unit
     identifier.
    :width: 400

  .. caution::
    Ensure you use ``/jump_to_id/<unit identifier>`` as the URL value. Do not
    use the URL of the unit that you see in the browser address bar.  If you do
    not use ``/jump_to_id/<unit identifier>``, the link will be broken if you
    export then import the course.

#. If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown arrow
   next to the **Target** field, and then select **New Window**. If not, you
   can leave the default value.

#. Select **Insert**.

#. Save the HTML component and test the link.

.. _Add a Link to a File:

=========================================
Add a Link to a File
=========================================

You can add a link in an HTML component to any file that is uploaded for the
course. For more information about uploading files, see :ref:`Add Files to a
Course`.

.. tip::
 When adding links to files, open the HTML component and the **Files &
 Uploads** page in separate browser windows. You can then more quickly copy and
 paste file URLs.

#. On the **Files & Uploads** page, copy the **Studio** URL of the file.

  .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Link_File.png
   :alt: An image of Files and Uploads page with the Studio URL field circled.
   :width: 600

  .. note::
   You must use the **Studio** URL to link to the file, not the **Web** URL.

2. In the HTML component where you want to add the link, select the text that
   you want to make into the link.

#. Select the link icon in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert link** dialog box, enter the Studio URL for the file in the
   **URL** field.

   ``/static/{FileName}.{type}``

   Make sure to include both forward slashes (/).

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-EditLink_File.png
    :alt: An image of the Insert link dialog box with a link to a file and the
     link text Syllabus.
    :width: 400

#. If you want the link to open in a new window, select the dropdown arrow
   next to the **Target** field, and then select **New Window**. If not, you
   can leave the default value.

#. Select **Insert**.

#. Save the HTML component and test the link.

.. _Add an Image to an HTML Component:

=========================================
Add an Image to an HTML Component
=========================================

When you use the visual editor, you can add any image that you have uploaded
for the course to an HTML component. For more information about uploading
images, see :ref:`Add Files to a Course`.

Review :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images` before you add images to
HTML components.

.. note::
 Ensure that you obtain copyright permissions for images you use in
 your course, and that you cite sources appropriately.

To add an image, you need the URL of the image that you uploaded to the
course. You then create a link to the image in the HTML component.

.. tip::
 When adding images, open the HTML component and the **Files &
 Uploads** page in separate browser windows. You can then more quickly copy and
 paste image URLs.

#. On the **Files & Uploads** page, copy the **Studio** URL of the image that
   you want. For an example illustration, see :ref:`Add a Link to a File`.

   .. note::
     You must use the **Studio** URL to add the image, not the **Web** URL.

#. In the HTML component where you want to add the link, select the image icon
   in the toolbar.

#. In the **Insert image** dialog box, enter the Studio URL for the file in the
   **URL** field.

   ``/static/{FileName}.{type}``

   Make sure to include both forward slashes (/).

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-Edit_Image.png
    :alt: An image of the Insert image dialog box with a reference to an image
     file.
    :width: 400

#. Enter alternative text in the **Image description** field. This text becomes
   the value of the ``alt`` attribute in HTML and is required for your course
   to be fully accessible. See :ref:`Best Practices for Describing Images` for
   more information.

#. As needed, customize the image dimensions. Keep **Constrain proportions**
   selected to ensure the image keeps the same width and height proportions.

   With **Constrain proportions** selected, you only change one dimension. When
   you tab out of the field, the other dimension changes to a value that
   maintains the same image proportions.

#. To change the spacing and border of the image, select the **Advanced** tab.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_Insert-Edit_Image_Advanced.png
    :alt: An image of the Insert image dialog box Advanced tab.

#. Enter the **Vertical space**, **Horizontal space**, and **Border** as
   needed. The values you enter are automatically added to the **Style** field.

#. Select **OK** to insert the image in the HTML component.

#. Save the HTML component and test the image.


.. _Import LaTeX Code:

=========================================
Import LaTeX Code into an HTML Component
=========================================

You can import LaTeX code into an HTML component. You might do this, for
example, if you want to create "beautiful math" such as the following.

.. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_LaTeX_LMS.png
 :alt: An image of math formulas created with LaTeX in an HTML component.
 :width: 600

.. warning::
 The LaTeX processor that Studio uses to convert LaTeX code to XML is a third-
 party tool. We recommend that you use this feature with caution. If you do use
 it, make sure to work with your partner manager.

Enable the LaTeX Processor
**************************

The LaTeX processor is not enabled by default. To enable it, you have to change
the advanced settings in your course.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the field for the **Enable LaTeX Compiler** policy key, change **false**
   to **true**.

#. At the bottom of the page, select **Save Changes**.

Add an HTML Component that Contains LaTeX Code
************************************************

When the LaTeX processor is enabled, you can create an HTML component that
contains LaTeX code.

#. In the unit where you want to create the component, select **html** under
   **Add New Component**, and then select **E-text Written in LaTeX**. The new
   component is added to the unit.

#. Select **Edit** to open the new component. The component editor opens.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/latex_component.png
    :alt: An image of the HTML component editor with the LaTeX compiler.
    :width: 600

#. In the component editor, select **Launch Latex Source Compiler**. The LaTeX
   editor opens.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_LaTeXEditor.png
    :alt: An image of the LaTeX editor.
    :width: 600

#. Write LaTeX code as needed. You can also upload a LaTeX file into the editor
   from your computer by selecting **Upload** in the bottom right corner.

#. When you have written or uploaded the LaTeX code you need, select **Save &
   Compile to edX XML** in the lower-left corner.

   The component editor closes. You can see the way your LaTeX content looks.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/HTML_LaTeX_CompEditor.png
    :alt: An image of the compontent with LaTeX code.
    :width: 600

#. On the unit page, select **Preview** to verify that your content looks the
   way you want it to look in the LMS.

   If you see errors, go back to the unit page. Select **Edit** to open the
   component again, and then select **Launch Latex Source Compiler** in the
   lower left corner of the component editor to edit the LaTeX code.
