Demo the New ORA Staff Grading Experience
#########################################

Initially, the new ORA staff grading experience will be available only in demo mode. 
his opt-in mode will allow staff to try the new experience on actual responses but
will disallow submitting grades to avoid conflicts with existing grading workflows.

To try out the new experience, staff can visit either of the locations where they would
normally begin grading a staff graded ORA: 

1. The Instructor dashboard. The dashboard will have a new column with a “Demo the new
   grading experience” link, which will direct to the new experience.

2. ORAs in a Unit. ORAs will introduce a new button saying “Demo the new grading
   experience” which will also direct to the new experience.

A banner on the page will indicate that the app is in demo mode and will explain the
limitations of this mode.

If, after trying demo mode, you'd like to enable the new staff grading experience as
the default, contact your partner support/manager to assist.
