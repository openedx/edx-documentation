You can access information about an individual student's performance on a peer assessment assignment, including:

* The student's response. 
* The peer assessments that other students performed on the student's response, including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall response.
* The peer assessments that the student performed on other students' responses, including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall responses.
