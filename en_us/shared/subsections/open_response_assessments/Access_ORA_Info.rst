After your open response assessment assignment has been released, you can access
information about the number of students in each step of the assignment or about
the performance of individual students. This information is available in the
**Course Staff Information** section at the end of each assignment. To access
student information, open the assignment in the courseware, scroll to the bottom
of the assignment, and then click the black **Course Staff Information** banner.

When you access a specific student's information for an open response
assessment, you can view his responses and, if necessary, :ref:`cancel the
student's submission<Remove a student response from peer grading>` so that it is
not included in peer assessments.

.. _PA View Metrics for Individual Steps:

************************************************
View Metrics for Individual Steps

You can check the number of students who have completed, or are currently
working through, the following steps:

* Submitted responses.
* Completed peer assessments.
* Waiting to assess responses or receive grades.
* Completed self assessments.
* Completed the entire assignment. 

To find this information, open the assignment in the courseware, scroll to the
bottom of the assignment, and then click **Course Staff Information**.

The **Course Staff Information** section expands, and you can see the number of
students who are currently working through (but have not completed) each step of
the problem.

.. _Access Information for a Specific Student:

***********************************************
Access Information for a Specific Student
***********************************************

You can access information about an individual student's performance on an open
response assessment assignment, including:

* The student's response. 
  
* The peer assessments that other students performed on the student's response,
  including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall response.
  
* The peer assessments that the student performed on other students' responses,
  including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall responses.
  
* The student's self assessment.

In the following example, you can see the performance information for a specific
student. This student's response received one peer assessment, and the student
completed a peer assessment on one other student's response. The student also
completed a self assessment.

To determine whether this student has received the required number of
assessments from other students and has completed the required number of
assessments for other students, refer to the **Graded By** and **Must Grade**
values that were set for the open response assessment assignment in Studio. For
more information about these settings, see :ref:`Specify Step Settings<PA
Specify Step Settings>`.

For details about accessing information for a specific student, and for an
example that shows a student's response with more assessments, see :ref:`Access
Student Information`.

.. _Remove a student response from peer grading:

************************************************
Remove a student response from peer grading
************************************************

If you use open response assessments, students might alert you to vulgar,
abusive, or otherwise inappropriate responses that they have seen while
performing peer assessments. In such a situation you can locate and cancel the
submission. Doing so removes the inappropriate response from peer assessments so
that it is no longer shown to other students.

.. note:: Removing a student's submission is an irreversible action. 

When you cancel an inappropriate submission, the response is immediately removed
from the pool of submissions available for peer assessment. If the inappropriate
response has already been sent to other students for peer assessment, it is also
removed from their queue. However, if any student has already graded the
inappropriate response, it is counted as one of the submissions they have
graded.

.. note:: After you remove an inappropriate response from peer assessment, you
   decide whether the student who submitted that response is allowed to submit a
   replacement response. If you do not want to allow the student to submit a
   replacement response, you do not need to take any additional action. The
   student receives a grade of zero for the entire submission. To allow the
   student to resubmit a response for a cancelled submission, :ref:`reset the
   student's attempts for the problem<reset_attempts>`.

Remove a submission from peer assessment by completing these steps.

#. In the LMS, go to the peer assessment assignment that contains the submission
   you want to remove.
   
#. Scroll to the bottom of the problem, then click the black **Course Staff
   Information** banner.
   
#. Scroll down to the **Get Student Info** box, enter the student's username in
   the box, and click **Submit**. 

   The student's information appears below the **Get Student Info** box.
   
#. Scroll down to the **Student Response** section and locate the submission you
   want to remove.

   :alt: Dialog allowing comments to be entered when removing a student submission
   
5. Enter a comment to document or explain the removal. This comment appears to
   the student when she views her response in the open response assessment
   problem.
   
#. Click **Remove submission**. 

   The inappropriate submission is removed from peer assessment. When you access
   this student's information again, instead of the response, you see a note
   showing the date and time that the submission was removed, and the comments
   that you entered.

   Removed submissions are also removed from the list of Top Responses if they
   were previously listed.
