Accessing Metrics for ORA Assignments
######################################

After you release an open response assessment assignment, you can access
various metrics for the assignment. For example, you can view the number of
learners in each step of the assignment or in possible states such as
"Waiting" or "Completed" within the assignment. In addition to viewing metrics
for the assignment, you can also access assignment details for an individual
learner.

For information about tasks that you can perform on learner responses in an
ORA assignment, including :ref:`performing a grade override
assessment<Override a learner assessment grade>` or :ref:`cancelling a
learner's submission<Remove a learner response from peer grading>`, see
:ref:`Managing ORA Assignments`.
