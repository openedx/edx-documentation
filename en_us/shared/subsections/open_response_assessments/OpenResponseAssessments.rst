Introduction to Open Response Assessments
*****************************************

Open response assessments allow instructors to assign questions that might not
have definite answers, such as text responses or short essays. Students submit
responses to questions, then each student and the student's peers compare the
responses to a rubric that you create. You can also allow students to upload an
image to accompany a text response.

Open response assessments include peer assessments and self assessments. In peer
assessments, students compare their peers' responses to a rubric that you
create. In self assessments, students compare their own responses to the rubric.

In open response assessments, students usually only see their own responses and
any peer responses they assess. You can also allow students to see the top-
scoring responses that their peers have submitted. For more information, see
:ref:`PA Top Responses`.

by-step instructions, see these sections:

.. _PA Elements:

==========================================
Elements of an Open Response Assessment
==========================================

When you create an open response assessment assignment, you include several
elements:

* One or more prompts, or questions.

* The rubric. One rubric is used to grade all the prompts in the
  assessment.
  
* One or more assessment steps. Assignments can include a student training step,
  a peer assessment step, and a self assessment step.

.. note:: If you include a student training step, you must also include a peer
   assessment step. The student training step must come first, before the peer
   and self assessment steps.

For step-by-step instructions for creating an open response assessment, see
:ref:`PA Create an ORA Assignment`.

*******
Prompts
*******

Each **prompt**, or question, that you want your students to answer, appears
near the top of the page, followed by a field where the student enters a
response. You can require your students to enter text as a response, or you can
allow your students to both enter text and upload an image.

.. note:: If students upload an image, the image file must be a .jpg or .png file, and it must be smaller than 5 MB in size.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_QandRField.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: Single ORA question and its corresponding blank response field

When you write each question, you can include helpful information for your
students, such as what they can expect after they submit responses, or the
approximate number of words or sentences that their response should have. 

.. note:: Each student is limited to a total word count of 10,000 for all
   responses in an ORA assignment.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Add Prompt`.


==========================================
Asking Students to Upload Images
==========================================


In open response assessments, you can ask your students to upload an image as
part of their response. If you do this, however, keep the following points in
mind.

* Currently, you cannot require your students to upload an image. You can only
  allow it.

* All responses must include some text. Students cannot submit a response that
  contains only an image.

* Students can submit only one image with each response.

.. note:: Currently, course teams cannot see any of the images that students
   submit. Images are not visible in the body of the assignment in the
   courseware, and they are not included in the course data package.

.. _PA Rubric:

******
Rubric
******

Your assignment must include a **rubric** that you design. The same rubric is
used for peer and self assessments, and the rubric appears when students begin
grading. Students compare their peers' responses to the rubric.

Rubrics consist of *criteria* and *options*.

* Each criterion has a *name*, a *prompt*, and one or more *options*. 

   * The name is a very short summary of the criterion, such as "Ideas" or
     "Content". Criterion names generally have just one word. Because the system
     uses criterion names for identification, **the name for each criterion must
     be unique.** Criterion names do not appear in the rubric that students see
     when they are completing peer assessments, but they do appear on the page
     that shows the student's final grade.

     .. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_CriterionName.png
        :alt: A final score page with call-outs for the criterion names

   * The prompt is a description of the criterion. 

   * Options describe how well the response satisfies the criterion.

* Each option has a *name*, an *explanation*, and a *point value*.

  .. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_Rubric_LMS.png
     :alt: Image of a rubric in the LMS with call-outs for the criterion prompt and option names, explanations, and points

Different criteria in the same assignment can have different numbers of options.
For example, in the image above, the first criterion has three options and the
second criterion has four options.

.. note:: You can also include criteria that do not have options, but that do include a field where students can enter feedback. For more information, see :ref:`PA Criteria Comment Field Only`.

You can see both criterion and option names when you access assignment
information for an individual student. For more information, see :ref:`Accessing
ORA Assignment Information`.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_Crit_Option_Names.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: Student-specific assignment information with call-outs for criterion and option names

When you create your rubric, decide how many points each option will receive,
and make sure that the explanation for each option is as specific as possible.
For example, one criterion and set of options may resemble the following.

**Criterion**

Name: Origins

Prompt: Does this response explain the origins of the Hundred Years' War? (5
points possible)

**Options**

.. list-table::
   :widths: 8 20 50
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Points
     - Name
     - Explanation
   * - 0
     - Not at all
     - This response does not address the origins of the Hundred Years' War.
   * - 1
     - Dynastic disagreement
     - This response alludes to a dynastic disagreement between England and France, but doesn't reference Edward III of England and Philip VI of France.
   * - 3
     - Edward and Philip
     - This response mentions the dynastic disagreement between Edward III and Philip VI, but doesn't address the role of Salic law.
   * - 5
     - Salic law
     - This response explains the way that Salic law contributed to the dynastic disagreement between Edward III and Philip VI, leading to the Hundred Years' War.

Andrade's `Understanding Rubrics
<http://learnweb.harvard.edu/alps/thinking/docs/rubricar.htm>`_.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Add Rubric`.

************************
Assessment Steps
************************

In your assignment, you'll also specify the **assessment steps**. You can set
the assignment to include a student training step, a peer assessment step, and a
self assessment step.

You can see the type and order of the assessments when you look at the
assignment. In the following example, after students submit a response, they
complete a student training step ("Learn to Assess Responses"), complete peer
assessments on other students' responses ("Assess Peers"), and then complete
self assessments ("Assess Your Response").

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_AsmtWithResponse.png
  :alt: Image of peer assessment with assessment steps and status labeled
  :width: 600

.. note:: If you include a student training step, you must also include a peer assessment step. The student training step must come before peer and self assessment steps.

.. _PA Student Training Assessments:

========================
Student Training Step
========================

When you create a peer assessment assignment, you can include one or more
student training assessments to help students learn to perform their own
assessments. A student training assessment contains one or more sample responses
that you write, together with the scores that you would give the sample
responses. Students review these responses and try to score them the way that
you scored them.

.. note:: If you include a student training step, you must also include a peer
   assessment step. The student training step must come before peer and self
   assessment steps.

In a student training assessment, the **Learn to Assess Responses** step opens
immediately after a student submits a response. The student sees one of the
sample responses that you created, along with the rubric. The scores that you
gave the response do not appear. The student also sees the number of sample
responses that he or she will assess.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_TrainingAssessment.png
   :alt: Sample training response, unscored
   :width: 500

The student selects an option for each of the assignment's criteria, and then
clicks **Compare your selections with the instructor's selections**. If all of
the student's selections match the instructor's selections, the next sample
response opens automatically.

If any of the student's selections differs from the instructor's selections, the
student sees the response again, and the following message appears above the
response:

.. code-block:: xml

  Learning to Assess Responses
  Your assessment differs from the instructor's assessment of this response. Review the
  response and consider why the instructor may have assessed it differently. Then, try 
  the assessment again.

For each of the criteria, the student sees one of the following two messages,
depending on whether the student's selections matched those of the instructor:

.. code-block:: xml

  Selected Options Differ
  The option you selected is not the option that the instructor selected.

.. code-block:: xml

  Selected Options Agree
  The option you selected is the option that the instructor selected.

For example, the following student chose one correct option and one incorrect
option.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_TrainingAssessment_Scored.png
   :alt: Sample training response, scored
   :width: 500

The student continues to try scoring the sample response until the student's
scoring for all criteria matches the instructor's scoring.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Student Training Step`.


=====================
Peer Assessment Step
=====================

In the peer assessment step, students review other students' responses. For each
response, they select an option for each criterion in your rubric based on the
response. Students can also provide text feedback, or comments, on each
response.


************************************
Number of Responses and Assessments
************************************

When you specify a peer assessment step, you specify the **number of responses**
that each student has to assess and the **number of peer assessments** that each
response has to receive.

.. note:: Because some students might submit a response without completing any
   peer assessments, some responses might not receive the required number of
   assessments. To increase the chance that all responses receive a sufficient
   number of assessments, you must set the number of responses that students
   must assess to be higher than the number of assessments that each response
   must undergo. For example, if you require each response to receive three
   assessments, you could require each student to assess five responses.

If all responses have received assessments, but some students have not completed
the required number of peer assessments, those students can assess responses
that other students have already assessed. The student who submitted the
response sees the additional peer assessments when he sees his score. However,
the additional peer assessments do not count toward the score that the response
receives.


.. _Feedback Options:

****************
Feedback Options
****************

By default, students see a single comment field below the entire rubric. You can
also add a comment field to an individual criterion or to several individual
criteria. This comment field can contain up to 300 characters.

The comment field appears below the options for the criterion. In the following
image, both criteria have a comment field. There is also a field for overall
comments on the response.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_CriterionAndOverallComments.png
   :alt: Rubric with comment fields under each criterion and under overall response
   :width: 600

For more information, see :ref:`PA Add Rubric` and :ref:`PA Criteria Comment
Field Only`.


.. _PA Scoring:

***********************
Peer Assessment Scoring
***********************

Peer assessments are scored by criteria. An individual criterion's score is the
median of the scores that each peer assessor gave that criterion. For example,
if the Ideas criterion in a peer assessment receives a 10 from one student, a 7
from a second student, and an 8 from a third student, the Ideas criterion's
score is 8.

A student's final score for a peer assessment is the sum of the median scores for each individual criterion. 

For example, a response may receive the following scores from peer assessors:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 10 10 10 10
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Criterion Name
     - Peer 1
     - Peer 2
     - Peer 3
     - Median
   * - Ideas (out of 10)
     - 10
     - 7
     - 8
     - **8**
   * - Content (out of 10)
     - 7
     - 9
     - 8
     - **8**
   * - Grammar (out of 5)
     - 4
     - 4
     - 5
     - **4**

To calculate the final score, add the median scores for each criterion:

  **Ideas median (8/10) + Content median (8/10) + Grammar median (4/5) = final
  score (20/25)**

.. note:: Remember that final scores are calculated by criteria, not by
   individual assessor. Therefore, the score for the response is not the median
   of the scores that each individual peer assessor gave the response.

********************************
Assessing Additional Responses
********************************

Students can assess more than the required number of responses. After a student
completes the peer assessment step, the step "collapses" so that just the
**Assess Peers** heading is visible.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_PAHeadingCollapsed.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: The peer assessment step with just the heading visible

If the student clicks the **Assess Peers** heading, the step expands. The student can then click **Continue Assessing Peers**.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_ContinueGrading.png
   :width: 500
   :alt: The peer assessment step expanded so that "Continue Assessing Peers" is visible


=====================
Self Assessment Step
=====================

In self assessments, the student sees his response followed by your rubric. As
with peer assessments, the student compares the rubric to his response and
selects an option for each of the criteria.

If you include both peer and self assessments, we recommend that you include the
peer assessment before the self assessment.

.. _PA Top Responses:

*****************************
Top Responses
*****************************

You can include a **Top Responses** section that shows the top-scoring responses
that students have submitted for the assignment, along with the scores for those
responses. The **Top Responses** section appears below the student's score
information after the student finishes every step in the assignment.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_TopResponses.png
   :alt: Section that shows the text and scores of the top three responses for the assignment
   :width: 500

You can allow the **Top Responses** section to show between 1 and 100 responses.
Keep in mind, however, that each response might be up to 300 pixels in height in
the list. (For longer responses, students can scroll to see the entire
response.) We recommend that you specify 20 or fewer responses to prevent the
page from becoming too long.

.. note:: It can take up to an hour for a high-scoring response to appear in the
   **Top Responses** list.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Show Top Responses`.
