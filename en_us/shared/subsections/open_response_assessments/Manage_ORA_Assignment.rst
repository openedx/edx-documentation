Managing Open Response Assessment Assignments
##############################################

After you publish an open response assessment and learners start to submit
responses and perform assessments, there are various actions you can take as a
member of the course staff.

.. _Access Information for a Specific Learner:

****************************************************
View a Specific Learner's Response and Assessments
****************************************************

You can view the following information about an individual learner's
performance in the open response assessment assignment.

* The text of the learner's response, including any files that the learner
  uploaded.
* The peer assessments that other learners performed on the learner's
  response, including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall
  response.
* The peer assessments that the learner performed on other learners'
  responses, including feedback on individual criteria and on the overall
  responses.
* The learner's self assessment.
* The learner's grade for the assignment.
* An override grade provided by course staff.

For more details about accessing information for a specific learner, and for an
example that shows a learner's response with peer assessments, see :ref:`Access
Learner Information`.

To determine whether a learner has received the required number of assessments
from other learners and has completed the required number of assessments for
other learners, refer to the **Graded By** and **Must Grade** values that were
set for the open response assessment assignment in Studio. For more
information about these settings, see :ref:`Specify Step Settings<PA Specify
Step Settings>`.


.. _Access Learner Information:

=======================================
Access a Specific Learner's Information
=======================================

Before you can access information about a specific learner's assignment, you
need the learner's username or email address. For more information, see
:ref:`View and download student data`.

#. In the course, go to the ORA assignment.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the problem, then select **Manage Individual
   Learners**.

#. Enter the learner's username or email address, then select **Submit**.

   The **Manage Individual Learners** dialog updates with expandable sections
   for each of the assessment steps in the assignment and other actions you
   can take on the learner's response. Only the types of assessment steps
   (self, peer, or staff) that are included in the assignment are shown.

   If the learner uploaded a file along with her response, select **View
   the file associated with this submission** to review or download it.

#. Select any of the section headings to expand that section.

.. _Perform a Staff Assessment:

*************************************************
Perform Staff Assessments in an ORA Assignment
*************************************************

When a staff assessment step is included in an open response assessment
assignment, course team members see a **Grade Available Responses** button at
the bottom of the assignment in the course, and learners see a **Staff
Assessment** step in their assignment.

.. note:: The scores that you give learners in staff assessment steps override
   scores from any other assessment type in the assignment, including peer
   assessments that are completed after the staff assessment.

To perform staff assessments in an assignment, complete these steps.

#. In the course, go to the ORA assignment.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the problem, then select **Grade Available
   Responses**.

   In the dialog that opens, the number of available and checked out responses
   is shown. Checked out responses are responses that are currently being
   graded by you or another course team member.

#. Select the **Staff Assessment** heading to open a response that is
   available for grading.

#. Perform an evaluation of the response using the problem's rubric.

#. Select **Submit assessment** to submit the assessment and close the grading
   dialog. Alternatively, select **Submit assessment and continue grading** to
   submit the assessment and immediately grade another submission.

   The grade that you have given this learner's response overrides scores from
   any other assessment type in the assignment. Peer assessments performed on
   this response after a staff grade has been given have no effect on the
   learner's final assignment grade.


.. _Override a learner assessment grade:

************************************************
Override a Learner's Assessment Grade
************************************************

For any open response assessment, whether or not a staff assessment step is
already included, you might want to override a learner's final grade for the
assignment. The ability to override the final grade is particularly useful in
assignments without staff assessment steps, for example, if a learner's
submission was inappropriately or inadequately graded by peers, or if there
are not enough peer reviewers to complete the required number of peer
assessments.

Course staff can perform an assessment of an individual learner's response
that acts as an override to the learner's existing grade. The grade given by
staff in the override assessment immediately replaces any other calculated
grade as the final grade for the learner.

.. note:: You can perform override assessments more than once on the same
   response, regardless of the due date of the assignment. The learner's
   final grade on the assessment is updated to reflect the most recent staff
   override assessment grade.

Learners who have override grades for their submissions see a **Staff
Assessment** step in their assignments, where they can view the rubric and any
comments provided in the staff assessments.


=======================================
Perform an Override Assessment
=======================================

To perform an override assessment for a particular learner, complete these steps.

#. In the course, go to the ORA assignment.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the problem, then select **Manage Individual
   Learners**.

#. Enter the learner's username or email, then select **Submit**.

   The **Manage Individual Learners** dialog updates with expandable sections
   for each of the assessment steps in the assignment and other actions you
   can take on the learner's response.

#. Select **Submit Assessment Grade Override**.

#. Perform an assessment of the learner's response using the problem's rubric.

#. When you have finished the assessment, select **Submit assessment**.

   The grade that you have given this learner's response becomes the learner's
   final grade on the assignment. Peer assessments are not taken into account
   in calculating the learner's final assignment grade when a staff override
   grade exists.

   Learners who have an override grade for their submission see a **Staff
   Assessment** step in their assignment, where they can view the rubric and
   any comments provided in the staff assessment.

.. note:: Override assessments can be performed more than once on the same
   response, regardless of the due date of the assignment. The learner's
   final grade on the assessment is updated to reflect the most recent staff
   override assessment grade.


.. _Remove a learner response from peer grading:

************************************************
Remove a Learner's Response from Peer Grading
************************************************

In a course that contains assignments with peer assessment steps, learners
might alert you to vulgar, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate responses that
they have seen while performing peer assessments. In such a situation you can
:ref:`locate<Locate a specific ORA submission>` and remove the submission.
Doing so removes the inappropriate response from peer assessments so that it
is no longer shown to other learners.

.. note:: Removing a learner's submission is an irreversible action.

When you remove an inappropriate submission, the response is immediately taken
out of the pool of submissions available for peer assessment. If the
inappropriate response has already been sent to other learners for peer
assessment, it is also removed from their queue. However, if any learner has
already graded the inappropriate response, it is counted as one of the
submissions they have graded.

.. note:: After you remove an inappropriate response from peer assessment, you
   decide whether the learner who submitted that response is allowed to submit a
   replacement response. If you do not want to allow the learner to submit a
   replacement response, you do not need to take any additional action. The
   learner receives a grade of zero for the entire submission. To allow the
   learner to resubmit a response for a cancelled submission, you must delete
   the learner's state for the problem. For more information, see
   :ref:`delete_state`.

To remove a submission from peer assessment, complete these steps.

#. Identify the learner who submitted the inappropriate response by following
   the steps in the :ref:`Locate a specific ORA submission` topic.

#. In the course, go to the ORA assignment that contains the submission you want
   to remove.

#. Scroll to the bottom of the problem, then select **Manage Individual Learners**.

#. Enter the learner's username or email, and select **Submit**.

   The **Manage Individual Learners** dialog updates with expandable sections
   for each of the assessment steps in the assignment and other actions you
   can take on the learner's response.

#. Select **Remove Submission from Peer Grading**.

#. Enter a comment to explain the removal. This comment appears to the learner
   when she views her response in the open response assessment problem.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/images/ORA_RemoveSubmission.png
    :alt: Dialog allowing comments to be entered when removing a learner
       submission.

6. Select **Remove submission**.

   The inappropriate submission is removed from peer assessment. Removed
   submissions are also removed from the list of Top Responses if they were
   previously listed.

When you access this learner's information again by selecting **Manage
Individual Learners**, instead of the response, you see a note showing the date
and time that the submission was removed, and the comments that you entered.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/images/ORA_StaffViewCancelledResponse.png
   :alt: In "Manage Individual Learners", the date, time and comment for removal
    of a learner response is shown instead of the original response.


When the learner views the assignment in the course, she sees that all steps in
the assignment have a status of "Cancelled". Under **Your Response**, instead of
the text of their response, she sees the date and time that their response was
cancelled, and the comments relating to the removal of their submission.


.. image:: ../../../../shared/images/ORA_LearnerViewCancelledResponse.png
   :alt: In a learner's view of the assignment, all steps have a status of
    Cancelled, and the learner sees the date, time and comment given for the
    removal of his submission.


.. _Locate a specific ORA submission:

*************************************************
Locate a Specific Submission in an ORA Assignment
*************************************************

If you are alerted to an inappropriate ORA submission that you want to cancel
and :ref:`remove from peer assessment<Remove a learner response from peer
grading>`, locate the specific submission by following these steps.

#. Ask the person who reported the incident to send you a sample of text from
   the inappropriate response.

#. Contact your edX partner manager to request a data download of ORA
   responses for your course.

   You will receive the download as a spreadsheet or in .csv file format.

#. Search the spreadsheet for text that matches the sample text from the
   inappropriate response.

#. From any matching entries in the spreadsheet, locate the username of the
   learner who posted the submission.

#. Make a note of the username, and follow the steps to :ref:`remove a learner
   response from peer grading<Remove a learner response from peer grading>`.
