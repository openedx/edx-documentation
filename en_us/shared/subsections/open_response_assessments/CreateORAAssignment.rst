Create an Open Response Assessment Assignment
#############################################


Creating an open response assessment is a multi-step process. Refer to each of
the following sections for step-by-step instructions.

* :ref:`PA Create Component`
* :ref:`PA Add Prompt`
* :ref:`PA Add Rubric`
* :ref:`PA Specify Name and Dates`
* :ref:`PA Select Assignment Steps`
* :ref:`PA Specify Step Settings`
* :ref:`PA Show Top Responses`
* :ref:`PA Test Assignment`

For more information about the components of an open response assessment, see
:ref:`Open Response Assessments 2`.


.. _PA Create Component:

******************************
Step 1. Create the Component
******************************

To create the component for your open response assessment, complete these steps.

#. In Studio, open the unit where you want to create the open response
   assessment.   
#. Under **Add New Component**, click **Problem**, click the **Advanced** tab,
   and then click **Peer Assessment**.
#. In the Problem component that appears, click **Edit**.


.. _PA Add Prompt:

******************************
Step 2. Add Prompts
******************************

To add prompts, or questions, complete these steps.

#. In the open response assessment component editor, select the **Prompt** tab.
#. Add the text of your question in the text field. Replace any default text if
   necessary.
#. Select **Add a Prompt** to add another prompt in the problem.


========================================
Add Formatting or Images to a Prompt
========================================

Currently, you cannot add text formatting or images inside the Peer Assessment
component. To include formatting or images within the text of a prompt, you
can add an HTML component that contains your text above the Peer Assessment
component, and leave the text field in the **Prompt** tab blank. The
instructions for the peer assessment still appear above the **Your Response**
field.

.. _PA Allow Images:

============================================
Allow Students to Submit Images (optional)
============================================


To allow students to submit an image with a response, complete these steps.

#. In the open response assessment component editor, click the **Settings** tab.
#. For **Allow Image Responses**, select **True**.

.. note:: 
 
   * The image file must be a .jpg or .png file, and it must be smaller than 5
     MB in size. 
   * Currently, course teams cannot see any of the images that
     students submit. Images are not visible in the body of the assignment in
     the courseware, and they are not included in the course data package.
   * You can allow students to upload an image, but you cannot require it.
   * Students can only submit one image with each response.     
   * All responses must contain text. Students cannot submit a response that
     contains only an image.

.. _PA Add Rubric:

******************************
Step 3. Add the Rubric
******************************

In this step, you add your rubric and provide your students with feedback
options. You add one rubric for each problem, regardless of the number of
prompts in the problem.

For each step below, replace any default text with your own text.

.. note:: All open response assessments include a feedback field below the
   rubric so that students can provide written feedback on a peer's overall
   response. You can also allow or require students to provide feedback for
   individual criteria. See step 2.4 below for instructions. For more
   information, see :ref:`Feedback Options`.

To add the rubric, complete these steps.

#. In the open response assessment component editor, click the **Rubric** tab.
#. In the first **Criterion** section, enter the name and prompt text of your first criterion.
#. In the first **Option** section, enter the name, explanation, and point value for the first option.
#. In the next **Option** section, enter the name, explanation, and point value for the next option.
#. Repeat step 4 for each option. If you need to add more options, click **Add Option**.
#. Next to **Feedback for This Criterion**, select a value in the drop-down list.

   * If you do not want students to provide feedback for this individual criterion, select **None**.
   * If you want to require students to provide feedback, select **Required**.
   * If you want to allow students to provide feedback, but not require it, select **Optional**.

7. Follow the instructions in steps 2-6 to add your remaining criteria. If you need to add more criteria, click **Add Criterion** at the end of the list of criteria.
#. Include instructions for students to provide overall written feedback on their peers' responses. You can leave the default text in the **Feedback Instructions** field or replace it with your own text.

.. _PA Criteria Comment Field Only:

==========================================================
Provide Only Comment Fields for Individual Criteria
==========================================================

When you add a comment field to a criterion, the comment field appears below the options for the criterion. You can also provide a comment field, but no options. 

In the following image, the first criterion has a comment field but no options. The second includes options, but does not have a comment field.

.. image:: ../../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/PA_0_Option_Criteria.png

To provide a comment field without options, complete these steps.

#. In the criterion, click **Remove** to remove, or delete, all the options.
#. Next to **Feedback for This Criterion**, select **Required** in the drop-down list.

.. _PA Specify Name and Dates:

************************************************************
Step 4. Specify the Assignment Name and Response Dates
************************************************************

To specify a name for the assignment as well as start and due dates for all
student responses, complete these steps.

#. In the component editor, click the **Settings** tab.
#. Next to **Display Name**, type the name you want to give the assignment.
#. Next to **Response Start Date** and **Response Start Time**, enter the date and time when you want students to be able to begin submitting responses. Note that all times are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
#. Next to **Response Due Date** and **Response Due Time**, enter the date and time by which all student responses must be submitted. Note that all times are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

.. note:: We recommend that you set the response due date and time at least two days before the peer assessment due date and time. If the response due time and peer assessment due time are close together, and a student submits a response just before responses are due, other students may not have time to perform peer assessments before peer assessments are due.

.. _PA Select Assignment Steps:

****************************************
Step 5. Select Assignment Steps
****************************************

Open response assessment assignments can include student training, peer assessment, and self assessment steps. You can include a peer assessment step before a self assessment step and vice versa. 

If you include a student training step, you **must** include a peer assessment step. You can also include a self assessment step. The student training step must come before both the peer assessment and the self assessment step.

To add steps to the assignment:

#. In the component editor, click the **Settings** tab.
#. Scroll down past the **Allow Image Responses** field.
#. Locate the following headings:

   * **Step: Student Training**
   * **Step: Peer Assessment**
   * **Step: Self Assessment**

   Select the check boxes for the steps that you want the assignment to include. 

#. (optional) If you want to change the order of the steps, drag the steps into the order that you want. If you include a student training step, make sure it is the first step in the assignment.

.. _PA Specify Step Settings:

******************************
Step 6. Specify Step Settings
******************************

After you select the steps that you want, you can specify settings for those
steps.

.. note:: If you make changes to a step, but then you clear the check box for that step, the step will no longer be part of the assignment and your changes will not be saved. 

.. _PA Student Training Step:

========================
Student Training
========================

For the student training step, you enter one or more responses that you have
created, then select an option for each criterion in your rubric.

.. note:: You must enter your complete rubric on the **Rubric** tab before you
   can select options for the student training responses. If you later change one
   of your criteria or any of its options, you must also update the student
   training step.

To add and score student training responses:

#. Under **Step: Student Training**, locate the first **Scored Response** section.
#. In the **Response** field, enter the text of your example response.
#. Under **Response Score**, select the option that you want for each criterion.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Student Training Assessments`.

============================
Peer Assessment
============================

For the peer assessment step, you specify the number of responses that each
student must grade, the number of students who must grade each response, and
start and due dates. All fields are required.

To specify peer assessment settings:

#. Locate the **Step: Peer Assessment** heading.
#. Next to **Must Grade**, enter the number of responses that each student must grade.
#. Next to **Graded By**, enter the number of students that must grade each response.
#. Next to **Start Date** and **Start Time**, enter the date and time when students can begin assessing their peers' responses. All times are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
#. Next to **Due Date** and **Due Time**, enter the date and time by which all peer assessments must be complete. All times are in UTC.

============================
Self Assessment
============================

For the self assessment step, you specify when the step starts and ends.

#. Locate the **Step: Self Assessment** heading.
   
#. Next to **Start Date** and **Start Time**, enter the date and time when
   students can begin assessing their peers' responses. All times are in
   Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
   
#. Next to **Due Date** and **Due Time**, enter the date and time by which all peer assessments must be complete. All times are in UTC.

.. _PA Show Top Responses:

******************************
Step 7. Show Top Responses
******************************

To allow students to see the top-scoring responses for the assignment, you
specify a number on the **Settings** tab.

#. In the component editor, click the **Settings** tab.
   
#. In the **Top Responses** field, specify the number of responses that you want
   to appear in the **Top Responses** section below the student's final score.
   If you do not want this section to appear, set the number to 0. The maximum
   number is 100.

.. note:: Because each response can be up to 300 pixels in height, we recommend
   that you set the number of top responses to 20 or lower, to prevent the page
   from becoming too long.

For more information, see :ref:`PA Top Responses`.


.. _PA Test Assignment:

******************************
Step 8. Test the Assignment
******************************

To test your assignment, set up the assignment in your course, set the section
or subsection date in the future, and ask a group of beta users to submit
responses and grade each other. The beta testers can then let you know if they
found the question and the rubric easy to understand or if they had any problems
with the assignment.

For more information about beta testing, see :ref:`Beta_Testing`.
