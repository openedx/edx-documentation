Staff Grading for Open Response Assignments
###########################################

The new Open Response Assessment (ORA) staff grading experience is designed to enable
more efficient and fully-featured grading workflows. With the new ORA staff grading
experience, staff can now easily:

* View the state of all submissions for an ORA
* Select individual/batch submissions to review
* Navigate between multiple submissions
* View responses and assign grades directly in the app
* Claim submissions for exclusive review to avoid grading conflicts

************************************************
Navigate to the New ORA Staff Grading Experience
************************************************

The new ORA staff grading experience replaces the old staff grading workflows. It can
be reached from the same places staff would normally go to review ORA submissions. That
is, from:

1. The Instructor Dashboard > Open Responses. In the responses table, ORAs with staff steps show a “View and grade responses” link which directs to the new experience.

2. The Unit > ORA > Grade Available Responses button links to the new grading experience.

.. Note:: Although the new staff grading experience replaces the old “Staff Assessment”
    workflows, grades can still be viewed, canceled, and overridden from the "Manage 
    Individual/Team Responses" link in ORAs.

*********************
Submissions List View
*********************

Opening the new grading experience shows a table listing responses for that particular
ORA. The table on the page shows the submitting user (or team, for team assignments),
the submission date, grade (if graded) and grading status. The grading status shows:

* “Ungraded” when the submission has not yet received a grade.
* “Currently being graded by someone else” when another staff member is actively grading this submission.
* “You are currently grading this response” when you have claimed the submission for grading but have not yet submitted a grade.
* “Grading Completed” when the submission has received a grade.

================================
Selecting Submissions for Review
================================

From the submission list view, staff can select the submissions which they would like
to review.  would like to review by checking the checkbox on the left of their row.
After selecting one or more submissions to review, they can click “View selected
responses” to begin reviewing the selected responses. Alternatively, staff can choose
not to select individual responses but click “View all responses” to review all
submitted responses for the ORA.

.. Note:: The page size of the submissions list is limited so it may be necessary to
    move between pages by clicking the “Previous” and “Next” buttons to view or select
    all the responses you're interested in reviewing.

*************************
View Individual Responses
*************************

The view that opens shows one selected submission at a time. This view allows staff to
review the submission's text response and uploaded files, if any. The top bar on the
page shows the current submission's submitting user or team, the current submission's
grading status, the grading controls, and buttons to navigate to the next/previous
selected submission.

=========================
File List & File Previews
=========================

If the response contains files, a “Submission Files'' list will show at the top of the
page. This lists the name, file type, and size for each uploaded file. Additionally, 
hovering over the info icon (ℹ) in the file row shows additional metadata about the 
uploaded file.

Some file types can be previewed directly on the page. The current file types that are
supported for in-page previews are: pdf, jpg, jpeg, png, bmp, txt, gif, jfif, pjpeg,
pjp, and svg. To view files that can't be previewed in-page (any other file types not
stated above) staff can download all files associated with the response as a zip file
by clicking the “Download files” button in the files card to get a Zip of files and
file metadata.

Text Responses
==============

If a submission also contains a text response (either plain text or rich text), the
text response will also show on the page, below any uploaded files.

View the Rubric
===============

While reviewing submission material, staff can view the rubric for the submission by
clicking the “Show Rubric'' button. This opens a non-editable rubric to help identify
the criteria staff should use for grading.

=============
Start Grading
=============

When staff is ready to grade they can begin grading with the “Start grading” button.
This will open an editable rubric which enables staff to select the score for a
submission and provide comments.

The “Start grading” button will also “claim” the current submission for grading. This
gives the staff member exclusive access to submit a grade for this submission, helping
to avoid grading conflicts. A submission that has been claimed is still visible to all
staff but cannot be graded by other staff until:

* The grading staff member submits the grade,
* The grading staff member releases the lock by clicking the “Stop grading” button, or
* After 8 hours elapses (whichever comes first). 

While the submission is claimed for grading, staff can select the appropriate rubric
options for each criteria and provide any required feedback before clicking “Submit 
grade” to submit their grade. Alternatively, if the staff member no longer wishes to
grade this response they can click the “Stop grading this response” button that now
appears at the top of the page.

=====================================
Navigate Between Selected Submissions
=====================================

At any point, staff can page between any of the previously selected responses by using
the arrows on the top bar of the page. Note that any submissions currently claimed for
grading remain claimed until a grade is entered or until the staff member exits the
application; navigating between submissions will not release a claim on the current
submission.

================
Override a Grade
================

After a submission has received a grade, it is still possible to override that grade.
Staff can navigate to a previously-graded submission and click “Override grade”. The
workflow for submitting a grade override is similar to submitting an initial grade:
select the appropriate rubric options and provide feedback before clicking “Submit
override”. A modal will ask to confirm if this is the intended action before overriding
the grade.
