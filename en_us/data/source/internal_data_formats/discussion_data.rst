Discussion Forums Data
######################

EdX discussion data is stored as collections of JSON documents in a MongoDB
database. MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database system. Documentation
can be found at the mongodb_ web site.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2

************************************
Data File and Object Overview
************************************

In the data package, discussion data is delivered in a .mongo file, identified
by organization and course, in the format
``{org}-{course}-{run}-{site}.mongo``.

The primary collection that holds all of the discussion posts written by users
is "contents". Two different types of objects are stored, representing the
three levels of interactions that users can have in a discussion.

* A ``CommentThread`` represents the first level of interaction: a post that
  opens a new thread, often a student question of some sort.

* A ``Comment`` represents both the second and third levels of interaction: a
  response made directly to the conversation started by a ``CommentThread`` is
  a ``Comment``. Any further contributions made to a specific response are also
  in ``Comment`` objects.

A sample of the field/value pairs that are in the .mongo file, and descriptions
of the attributes that these two types of objects share and that are specific
to each type, follow.

In addition to these collections, events are also emitted to track specific
user activities. For more information, see :ref:`forum_events`.

Two sample rows, or JSON documents, from a ``.mongo`` file of discussion data
follow.

CommentThread Document Example

The JSON documents that include discussion data are delivered in a compact,
machine-readable format that can be difficult to read at a glance.

If you use a JSON formatter to "pretty print" this document, a version that is
more readable is produced.

*****************
Shared Fields
*****************

Descriptions of the fields that are present for both ``CommentThread`` and
``Comment`` objects follow.

--------------------
_id
--------------------
  The 12-byte MongoDB unique ID for this collection. Like all MongoDB IDs, the
  IDs are monotonically increasing and the first four bytes are a timestamp.

--------------------
_type
--------------------
  ``CommentThread`` or ``Comment`` depending on the type of object.

--------------------
anonymous
--------------------
  If true, this ``CommentThread`` or ``Comment`` displays in the user interface
  as written by "anonymous", even to course team members and discussion team
  members.

--------------------
anonymous_to_peers
--------------------
  If true, this ``CommentThread`` or ``Comment`` displays in the user interface
  as written by "anonymous" to students, but members of the course team and the
  discussion team can see the author's username.

--------------------
at_position_list
--------------------
  No longer used. Child comments (replies) are sorted by their ``created_at``
  timestamp only.

--------------------
author_id
--------------------
  Identifies the user who wrote this. Corresponds to the user IDs stored in the
  MySQL database as ``auth_user.id``.

--------------------
author_username
--------------------
  The username of the person who wrote the discussion post or comment.

--------------------
body
--------------------
  Text of the comment in Markdown. UTF-8 encoded.

--------------------
course_id
--------------------
  The full course_id of the course that this comment was made in, including org
  and run. This value can be seen in the URL when browsing the courseware
  section. Example: ``BerkeleyX/Stat2.1x/2013_Spring``.

.. 12 Feb 14, Sarina: not yet relevant but with splitmongo changes course_id conventions will change. may be worth discussing with Don et al as to when we expect these changes to land and how to document.

--------------------
created_at
--------------------
  Timestamp in UTC. Example: ``ISODate("2013-02-21T03:03:04.587Z")``.

.. FOR-482 open to research inconsistency between the data actually in the data package and this example and description.

--------------------
updated_at
--------------------
  Timestamp in UTC. Example: ``ISODate("2013-02-21T03:03:04.587Z")``.

.. FOR-482 open to research inconsistency between the data actually in the data package and this example and description.

--------------------
votes
--------------------
  Both ``CommentThread`` and ``Comment`` objects support voting. In the user
  interface, students can vote for posts (``CommentThread`` objects) and for
  responses, but not for the third-level comments made on responses. All
  ``Comment`` objects still have this attribute, even though there is no way to
  actually vote on the comment-level items in the UI. This attribute is an
  object that has the following items inside.

  * up = list of User IDs that up-voted this comment or thread.
  * down = (no longer used) list of User IDs that down-voted this comment or
    thread.
  * up_count = total upvotes received.
  * down_count = No longer used. Total downvotes received.
  * count = total votes cast.
  * point = net vote, now always equal to up_count.

A user only has one vote per ``Comment`` or ``CommentThread``. Though it's
still written to the database, the UI no longer displays an option to downvote
anything.

**************************
CommentThread Fields
**************************

The following fields are specific to ``CommentThread`` objects. Each thread in
the discussion forums is represented by one ``CommentThread``.

--------------------
closed
--------------------
  If true, this thread was closed by a discussion forum moderator or admin.

--------------------
comment_count
--------------------
  The number of comment replies in this thread. This includes all responses and
  replies, but does not include the original post that started the thread. In
  this example, the ``comment_count`` for the initial ``CommentThread`` is
  **4**.

    CommentThread: "What's a good breakfast?"
      * Comment: "Just eat cereal!"
      * Comment: "Try a Loco Moco, it's amazing!"
        * Comment: "A Loco Moco? Only if you want a heart attack!"
        * Comment: "But it's worth it! Just get a spam musubi on the side."

--------------------
commentable_id
--------------------
  A course team can attach a discussion to any piece of content in the course,
  or to top level categories like "General" and "Troubleshooting". When the
  discussion is a top level category it is specified in the course's policy
  file, and the ``commentable_id`` is formatted like this:
  "i4x-edX-edX101-course-How_to_Create_an_edX_Course".
  When the discussion is a specific component in the course, the
  ``commentable_id`` identifies that component:
  "d9f970a42067413cbb633f81cfb12604".

--------------------
last_activity_at
--------------------
  Timestamp in UTC indicating the last time there was activity in the thread
  (new posts, edits, etc). Closing the thread does not affect the value in this
  field.

.. FOR-482 open to research inconsistency between the data actually in the data package and this example and description.

--------------------
tags_array
--------------------
  No longer used.

  **History**: Intended to be a list of user definable tags.

--------------------
title
--------------------
  Title of the thread. UTF-8 string.

--------------------
thread_type
--------------------
  Identifies the type of post as a "question" or "discussion".

  **History**: Added 4 Sep 2014.

********************
Comment Fields
********************

The following fields are specific to ``Comment`` objects. A ``Comment`` is
either a response to a ``CommentThread`` (such as an answer to the question),
or a reply to another ``Comment`` (a comment about somebody's answer).

**History**: It used to be the case that ``Comment`` replies could nest much
more deeply, but this was later capped at just these three levels (post,
response, comment) much in the way that StackOverflow does.

--------------------
visible
--------------------
  Not used.

--------------------
abuse_flaggers
--------------------
  Records the user id of each user who selects the **Report Misuse** flag for a
  ``Comment`` in the user interface. Stores an array of user ids if more than
  one user flags the ``Comment``. This is empty if no users flag the
  ``Comment``.

----------------------------------------
historical_abuse_flaggers
----------------------------------------
  If a discussion moderator removes the **Report Misuse** flag from a
  ``Comment``, all user IDs are removed from the ``abuse_flaggers`` field and
  then written to this field.

--------------------
endorsed
--------------------
  Boolean value. True if a forum moderator has marked this response to a
  ``CommentThread`` with a ``thread_type`` of "discussion" as a valuable
  contribution, or if a forum moderator or the originator of a
  ``CommentThread`` with a ``thread_type`` of "question" has marked this
  response as the correct answer.

  The ``endorsed`` field is present for comments that are made as replies to
  responses, but in these cases the value is always false: the user interface
  does not offer a way to endorse comments.

--------------------
endorsement
--------------------
  Contains ``time`` and ``user_id`` fields for the date and time that this
  response to a post was endorsed and the numeric user ID (from
  ``auth_user.id``) of the person who endorsed it.

  **History**: Added 4 Sep 2014.

--------------------
comment_thread_id
--------------------
  Identifies the ``CommentThread`` that the ``Comment`` is a part of.

--------------------
parent_id
--------------------
  Applies only to comments made to a response. In the example given for
  ``comment_count`` above, "A Loco Moco? Only if you want a heart attack!" is a
  comment that was made to the response, "Try a Loco Moco, it's amazing!"

  The ``parent_id`` is the ``_id`` of the response-level ``Comment`` that this
  ``Comment`` is a reply to. Note that this field is only present in a
  ``Comment`` that is a reply to another ``Comment``; it does not appear in a
  ``Comment`` that is a reply to a ``CommentThread``.

--------------------
parent_ids
--------------------
  The ``parent_ids`` field appears in all ``Comment`` objects, and contains the
  ``_id`` of all ancestor comments. Since the UI now prevents comments from
  being nested more than one layer deep, it will only ever have at most one
  element in it. If a ``Comment`` has no parent, it is an empty list.

--------------------
sk
--------------------
  A randomly generated number that drives a sorted index to improve online
  performance.
