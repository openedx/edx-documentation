.. _Institution_Data:

#######################
Institution-wide Data
#######################

The data package includes a report of data collected across all of an
institution's edx.org or edge.edx.org courses. This report is typically more
useful to administrative or marketing teams, rather than research teams.

.. _Email Opt In Report:

*********************
Email Opt In Report
*********************

When students enroll in a course on edx.org, they can specify whether they
want to receive email from the organization that presents the course.

The ``{org}-email_opt_in-{site}-analytics.csv`` file reports the email
preference selected by each student enrolled in your institution's courses.
You can use this information to develop a distribution list for campaigns that
introduce new or related courses to students.

.. note:: Your data package includes a .csv file for the edx.org site only. 
  At this time, students can specify an email preference only on edx.org.

The file contains data in these columns.
