Events in the Tracking Logs
############################################

This section provides reference information about the event data that is
delivered in data packages. Events are emitted by the server, the browser, or
the mobile device to capture information about interactions with the courseware
and the Instructor Dashboard in the LMS, and are stored in JSON documents. In
the data package, event data is delivered in a log file.

.. contents::

  :depth: 1

The student and course team events are grouped into categories in this section.
For a complete, alphabetical list of events, see the :ref:`event_list`.

A sample event from an edX.log file follows. This sample was edited to remove
personally identifiable information. Events are stored in JSON documents, which
can be difficult to read before standard formatting is applied.

other types of events, see :ref:`Student_Event_Types` or
:ref:`Instructor_Event_Types`.

.. _common:

*****************************
Common Fields
*****************************

This section describes the JSON fields that are common to the schema
definitions of all events. These fields are at the root level of the event
JSON documents.

This section presents the common fields in alphabetical order. Actual events
in your data package can include these fields in different sequences.

===========================
``accept_language`` Field
===========================

**Type:** string

**Details:** The value from the HTTP Accept-Language request-header field. For
more information, see the HTTP/1.1 header field definition for
`Accept-Language`_.

**History:** Added 23 Feb 2015.

=====================
``agent`` Field
=====================

**Type:** string

**Details:** Browser agent string of the user who triggered the event.

.. _context:

===================
``context`` Field
===================

**Type:** dictionary

**Details:**

The ``context`` field includes member fields that provide contextual
information.

* This field contains a core set of member fields that are common to all events.
* For certain events with additional contextual requirements, this field
  contains a set of additional member fields that are common to those events
  only.
* For any event, this field can also include one or more additional member
  fields. For more information about the ``context`` member fields for an
  event, see the description of that event later in this section.

``context`` Member Fields Common to All Events
***********************************************

The following member fields are present in the ``context`` field for all events.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``context`` Member Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``course_id``
     - string
     - Identifies the course that generated the event.
   * - ``org_id``
     - string
     - The organization that lists the course.
   * - ``path``
     - string
     - The URL that generated the event.
   * - ``user_id``
     - integer
     - Identifies the individual who is performing the action.


``context`` Member Fields for Applicable Events
******************************************************

When applicable for an event, the ``context`` field also includes these member
fields to provide additional information.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - ``context`` Member Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``course_user_tags``
     - dictionary
     - Contains the key(s) and value(s) from the ``user_api_usercoursetag``
       table for the user. See :ref:`user_api_usercoursetag`.
   * - ``module``
     - dictionary
     - Contains a dictionary that identifies the components involved in a
       server event.

       For example, in a server ``problem_check`` event, the ``module`` field
       indicates the problem component that the server checked successfully.
       The member fields of this dictionary are ``display_name`` and
       ``usage_key``.

       For modules that are used in a course to present content from a
       library, this dictionary also includes the ``original_usage_key`` and
       ``original_usage_version`` fields. These member fields provide a
       consistent way to identify components that are sourced from a library,
       and can be used to identify the source library.


The ``context`` member fields are blank if values cannot be determined.

**History**: ``usage_key`` added 28 Jan 2015. ``path`` added 07 May 2014.
``course_user_tags`` added 12 Mar 2014. ``user_id`` added 6 Nov 2013. Other
event fields may duplicate this data. Added 23 Oct 2013.

===================
``event`` Field
===================

**Details:** IP address of the user who triggered the event. Empty for events
that originate on mobile devices.

===================
``name`` Field
===================

**Type:** string

**Details:** Identifies the type of event triggered.

**History:** Server and mobile events added beginning on 07 May 2014 include a

===================

**Type:** string

**Details:** This 32-character value is a key that identifies the user's
session. All browser events and the server :ref:`enrollment<enrollment>` events
include a value for the session. Other server events and mobile events do not
include a session value.

===================
``time`` Field
===================

**Type:** string

**Details:** Gives the UTC time at which the event was emitted in
'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.xxxxxx' format.

===================
``username`` Field
===================

**Type:** string

**Details:** The username of the user who caused the event to be emitted. This
string is empty for anonymous events, such as when the user is not logged in.

.. _Student_Event_Types:

****************************************
Student Events
****************************************

This section lists the events that are typically initiated by learners. These
events are generated by interactions with the learning management system (LMS)
other than the Instructor Dashboard.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1


The descriptions that follow include what each event represents, the system
component it originates from, the history of any changes made to the event
over time, and any additional member fields that the common ``context`` or
``event`` fields contain. For more information about the common ``context`` or
``event`` fields, see :ref:`common`.

The value in the ``event_source`` field (see the :ref:`common` section above)
distinguishes between events that originate in the browser (in JavaScript) and
events that originate on the server (during the processing of a request).

.. _enrollment:

=========================
Enrollment Events
=========================

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

* ``edx.course.enrollment.activated``
* ``edx.course.enrollment.deactivated``
* ``edx.course.enrollment.mode_changed``
* ``edx.course.enrollment.upgrade.clicked``
* ``edx.course.enrollment.upgrade.succeeded``

``edx.course.enrollment.activated`` and ``edx.course.enrollment.deactivated``
*****************************************************************************

The server emits these events in response to course enrollment
activities completed by a student.

* When a student enrolls in a course, the server emits an
  ``edx.course.enrollment.activated`` event. For example, when a student
  clicks **Enroll** for a course on the edx.org site, the server emits this
  event.

* When a student unenrolls from a course, the server emits an
  ``edx.course.enrollment.deactivated`` event. For example, when a student
  clicks **Unenroll** for a course on the edx.org site, the server emits this
  event.

In addition, actions by course team members also generate
enrollment events. For the actions that members of the course team complete
that result in these events, see :ref:`instructor_enrollment`.

**Event Source**: Server

**History**: These enrollment events were added on 03 Dec 2013. On 07 May
2014, the ``name`` field was added. These enrollment events include both a
``name`` field and an ``event_type`` field.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``course_id``
     - string
     - The course in which the student was enrolled or unenrolled.

       If an external tool is used to enroll or unenroll students, this field
       contains a value and the ``context.course_id`` field is null.

   * - ``mode``
     - string
     - 'audit', 'honor', 'professional', 'verified'. Identifies the student's
       enrollment mode.
   * - ``user_id``

A browser or the edX mobile app emits video interaction events when a user
interacts with a video.

* When users use a browser to stream video files on a desktop computer or
  mobile device, the browser emits the events.

* When users use the edX mobile app to stream or download course videos for
  offline viewing, the mobile app emits the events.

  When a user interacts with a downloaded video file offline using the edX
  mobile app, note that the app can only forward its events during the next
  connection opportunity. As a result, the date and time in the event's
  ``time`` field can be different from the date and time in its
  ``context.received_at`` field. Data packages can include events emitted on
  past dates.

This section presents the video interaction events alphabetically. Typically,
an interaction with the video player begins with a :ref:`play_video` event.

For courses that include a pre-roll video, user interactions with the pre-roll
video result in different events. For more information, see :ref:`pre-roll`.

**Component**: Video

**History**: The edX mobile app for iOS began to emit a subset of the video
events on 25 Feb 2015. The edX mobile app for Android began to emit a subset
of the video events on 23 Dec 2014.


``hide_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.hidden``
***************************************************

When a user selects **CC** to suppress display of the video transcript, the
browser or mobile app emits a ``hide_transcript`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``hide_transcript``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.transcript.hidden``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for iOS. Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for
``hide_transcript``/ ``edx.video.transcript.hidden`` events as for the
:ref:`play_video` events. For an example of an event with these fields, see
:ref:`Example Mobile App Event`.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``hide_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.hidden`` events include the
following ``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for
events of this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``currentTime``: The point in the video file at which the transcript was
  hidden.
* ``id``

``load_video``/``edx.video.loaded``
***********************************

When the video is fully rendered and ready to play, the browser or mobile app
emits a ``load_video`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``load_video``, the events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.loaded``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for iOS. Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for
``load_video`` events as for :ref:`play_video`. For an example of an event
with these fields, see
:ref:`Example Mobile App Event`.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``load_video``/ ``edx.video.loaded`` events include the following ``event``
member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for events of this type as
for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``id``

``pause_video``/``edx.video.paused``
*************************************

When a user selects the video player's **pause** control, the player emits a
``pause_video`` event. For videos that are streamed in a browser, when the
player reaches the end of the video file and play automatically stops it emits
both this event and a ``stop_video`` event (as of June 2014).

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Stop Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Stop Time** is
  present for the video, the player stops at the specified time and emits the
  ``pause_video`` and ``stop_video`` events.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in the edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Stop Time** and plays the file to its end. The app
  then emits only the ``stop_video`` event.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video
Components` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``pause_video``, the events
that the edX mobile app emits include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.paused``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**:

* Updated 5 May 2015 to include the effect of a **Video Stop Time**.

* ``id``

.. _play_video:

``play_video``/``edx.video.played``
***********************************

When a user selects the video player's **play** control, the player emits a
``play_video`` event.

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Start Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Start Time** is
  present for the video, the player starts at the specified time and emits the
  ``play_video`` event.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in the edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Start Time** and emits the ``play_video`` event
  when it plays the file from the beginning.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video
Components` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``play_video``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of

``seek_video``/``edx.video.position.changed``
*********************************************

A browser emits ``seek_video`` events when a user selects a user interface
control to go to a different point in the video file.

* On a desktop computer, users can click and drag in the playback bar or click
  in a transcript to change position.
* In the edX mobile app, users can click and drag in the playback bar or tap
  the "back 30 seconds" button to change position.
* When using a browser on a mobile device, users can click and drag in the
  playback bar to change position.

In addition to the value ``seek_video`` in the ``event_type`` field, the
events that the edX mobile app emits include the value
``edx.video.position.changed`` in the ``name`` field.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**:

* Updated 10 Mar 2015 to include the final implementation for events emitted
  by the edX mobile app for Android and iOS. Prototype events were emitted by
  the mobile app in February and March 2015.

* Prior to 25 Jun 2014, the ``old_time`` and ``new_time`` fields were set to
  the same value.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for

       different point in the file.
   * - ``requested_skip_interval``
     - integer
     - Applies only to events with an  ``event_source`` of 'mobile'. The number
       of seconds that the user moved backward (expressed as a negative) or
       forward in the file.

       **History**: Added 10 Mar 2015.

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - The navigational method used to change position within the video.

       In events for a user of a desktop computer, this value can be

       app, this value can be 'onSlideSeek' or 'onSkipSeek'.


``show_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.shown``
**************************************************

When a user selects **CC** to display the video transcript, the browser or
mobile app emits a ``show_transcript`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``show_transcript``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.transcript.shown``.

     - The speed at which the video was playing.

``stop_video``/``edx.video.stopped``
*************************************

When the video player reaches the end of the video file and play automatically
stops, the player emits a ``stop_video`` event.

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Stop Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Stop Time** is
  present for the video, the player stops at the specified time and emits the
  ``pause_video`` and ``stop_video`` events.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Stop Time** and plays the file to its end. The
  app then emits the ``stop_video`` event.

Pre-Roll Video Interaction Events
==================================

Course teams can create a short video message and configure it to play
automatically before the videos in a course.

* The pre-roll video plays on an infrequent schedule of once per user per week.

* Only courses that run on the edx.org website can include a pre-roll video.

* The edX mobile applications do not play pre-roll videos.

When a user interacts with the pre-roll video, different events are emitted
than for the other videos in the course. This section presents the pre-roll
video events alphabetically.

For more information about pre-roll videos, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding
a Pre-Roll Video` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

Problem interaction events are emitted by the server or the browser to capture
information about interactions with problems.

These events were designed for the problem types implemented in the edX
platform by the ``capa_module.py`` XBlock. Problem types that are implemented
by other XBlocks, such as :ref:`open response assessments<ora2>` or :ref:`polls
and surveys<Poll and Survey Events>`, are instrumented with different events.

For more information about designing problems to include hints, feedback, or
both, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem` in
the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

``edx.problem.hint.demandhint_displayed``

       the feedback message.
   * - ``hints``
     - array
     - Contains a ``text`` member field with the feedback string that was
       displayed to the user. For some problem types, such as checkbox
       problems, feedback can be provided for more than one answer at a time,
       including both correct and incorrect answers. A separate ``text`` member
       field is included for each feedback message that was displayed.

       'stringresponse' for a text input problem.
   * - ``student_answer``
     - array
     - The answer value selected or supplied by the user. For problem types
       that accept multiple answers, such as checkbox problems, every response,
       including both selected and unselected options, is included.
   * - ``trigger_type``
     - string
     - Identifies the type of feedback elicited by the ``student_answer``
       response. For checkbox problems only, course teams can design 'compound'
       feedback that is provided when a user's response matches an exact set of
       correct and incorrect selections across all of the available choices.
       All other types of feedback are identified as 'single'.

.. _library_events:

==========================
Library Interaction Events
==========================

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

* ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned``
* ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed``

Course teams in an organization can collaboratively contribute to libraries of
content, such as a collection of problem components for a particular subject.
Libraries are created and maintained separately from courses so that their
content can be used in different courses.

In a course outline, course teams can include randomized content block
components that reference a library and deliver its content to students. In a
randomized content block component, the course team defines how many of the
library components to deliver to each student.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Content Libraries`.

.. xref to come from Carol

``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned``
********************************************

The server emits an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event the
first time that content from a randomized content block is delivered to a
user. The ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event identifies the
components delivered from the library to a user.

Additional ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events can also be
emitted if the course team makes a change that results in an increase in the
number of components that the randomized content block delivers. After such a
change, the randomized content block delivers more components to any user who
revisits it after that change. For those users, the
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event identifies the complete set
of components delivered from the library and also the components that were
delivered for the first time.

**Event Source**: Server

**History** Added 18 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``added``
     - list
     - Lists the library components that were delivered to the user for the
       first time. The content of this field is different from the content of
       the ``result`` field only if the user revisited the randomized content
       block and it delivered additional components from the library.
   * - ``location``
     - string
     - Identifies the randomized content block component.
   * - ``max_count``
     - integer
     - The **Count** specified by a course team member in Studio. Defines the
       number of library components to deliver. This number is greater than
       the number of library components listed by the ``result`` field only
       when the library has too few matching blocks available.
   * - ``previous_count``
     - integer
     - The number of components assigned to this student before this event.
       The first time the user views the randomized content block, this value
       is 0.
   * - ``result``
     - list
     - Lists all of the library components delivered to the user.

       * ``descendants``, when present, is a list that identifies each
         part of a library component that contains multiple parts (the
         children of an XBlock with children).

       * ``original_usage_key`` and ``original_usage_version`` identify the
         component in the library.

         When students attempt a problem component delivered by a randomized
         content block, the resulting problem events also reference the
         ``original_usage_key`` and ``original_usage_version`` in
         ``context.module`` member fields. See :ref:`context`.

       * ``usage_key`` identifies the location of this component in the
         course. This value identifies a child of the randomized
         content block component.

       To identify a component consistently within a course, you can use
       either ``usage_key`` or ``original_usage_key`` as a consistent
       identifier. To identify components across courses, use
       ``orignal_usage_key``.


``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed``
*******************************************

The server emits an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` event when a
user revisits a randomized content block and one or more of the components
that were previously delivered to that user can no longer be delivered.

* If components are removed from the library and the course team
  resynchronizes the randomized content block to the library, the server emits
  an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` event if a user who was
  previously assigned one of those components revisits the randomized content
  block or accesses the progress page.

* If the course team changes settings for the randomized content block so that
  fewer or different components are allowed.

  For example, the course team reduces the number of library components to
  deliver or specifies a different type of problem to deliver.

**Event Source**: Server

**History** Added 18 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` events include the following
``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for events of
this type as for the ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events.

* ``location``
* ``max_count``
* ``previous_count``
* ``result``

The following additional ``event`` member fields apply specifically to
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` events.

       components to deliver.

       'invalid' if the component is no longer included in the library, or no
       longer matches the settings specified for the randomized content block.

   * - ``removed``
     - list
     - Identifies the components that are no longer delivered to this user.
       This field contains the same member fields as the ``event.result``
       field for ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events.


.. _forum_events:

==========================
Discussion Forums Events
==========================

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

* ``edx.forum.comment.created``
* ``edx.forum.response.created``
* ``edx.forum.searched``
* ``edx.forum.thread.created``

The server emits discussion forums events when a user interacts with a course
discussion. This section presents the discussion forum events alphabetically.
However, several of these events have hierarchical or sequential
relationships.

* When a user creates a new thread, such as a student asking a question, the
  server emits an :ref:`forum_thread` event.

* When a user responds to a thread, such as another student answering the
  question, the server emits an :ref:`forum_response` event.

* When a user adds a comment to a response, such as a course team member adding
  a clarification to the student answer, the server emits an
  :ref:`forum_comment` event.

These events are included in the daily event logs in addition to the MongoDB
discussion forums database data that is included in the weekly database data
files. For information about the discussion forums database, see
:ref:`Discussion Forums Data`.

If a thread, response, or comment was part of a team discussion within a
course, a ``team_id`` field is included in the ``edx.forum.thread.created``,
``edx.forum.response.created``, or ``edx.forum.comment.created`` event to
identify the team in which the discussion event was triggered. For more
information about events for teams, see :ref:`student_teams_events`.

  :depth: 1

In an open response assessment, students review a question and then submit a
text response and, optionally, an image file. To evaluate their own and one or
more other students' responses to the questions, students use a scoring rubric
designed by the course team. For more information about open response
assessments, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:PA Create an ORA Assignment`.

.. _AB_Event_Types:

========================================
Testing Events for Content Experiments
========================================

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

* ``assigned_user_to_partition``
* ``child_render``

Course authors can configure course content to present modules that contain
other modules. Content experiments, also known as A/B or split tests, use this
structure. For example, a parent module can include two child modules that
contain content that differs in some way for comparison testing.

* Internally, a *partition* defines the type of experiment: comparing the
  effectiveness of video alone to text alone, for example. A course can include
  any number of modules that have the same partition or experiment type.

* For each partition, students are randomly assigned to a *group*. The group
  determines which content, either video or text in this example, is shown by
  every module with that partitioning.

* Students are assigned to groups randomly. Assignment to a group takes place
  when student navigation through the course requires data from that module.
  For example, one student is assigned to a group when he visits the course
  progress page, while another student is assigned to a group when she visits a
  course component that is the parent module of a content experiment. Based on
  this random group assignment, the content of just one of the two child
  modules is shown to the student.

* For investigations into which students in each group actually interacted with
  tested content, review the events for the behavior you want to learn about.
  For example, review the students' ``play_video`` ,
  ``textbook.pdf.page.navigated``, or ``problem_check`` events.

The events that follow apply to modules that are set up to randomly assign
students to groups so that different content can be shown to the different
groups.

For more information about how course teams add content experiments to their
courses, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Add Content Experiments to Your Course`.

**History**: These events were added on 12 Mar 2014.

``assigned_user_to_partition``
*********************************

When a student views a module that is set up to test different child modules,
the server checks the ``user_api_usercoursetag`` table for the student's
assignment to the relevant partition, and to a group for that partition.

* The partition ID is the ``user_api_usercoursetag.key``.

* The group ID is the ``user_api_usercoursetag.value``.

If the student does not yet have an assignment, the server emits an
``assigned_user_to_partition`` event and adds a row to the
``user_api_usercoursetag`` table for the student. See
:ref:`user_api_usercoursetag`.

.. note:: After this event is emitted, the common ``context`` field in all
 subsequent events includes a ``course_user_tags`` member field with the
 student's assigned partition and group.

For information about including student cohorts in a course, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Cohorts Overview` in the *Building and Running an edX
Course* guide.

``edx.cohort.created``
*********************************

When a course team or the system creates a cohort, the server emits an
``edx.cohort.created`` event. Cohorts can be created manually by members of the
course team. The system automatically creates the default cohort and any
cohorts that are defined by the ``auto_cohort_groups`` advanced setting when
they are needed (for example, when a student is assigned to one of those
cohorts).

Additional events are emitted when members of the course team interact with the
Instructor Dashboard to create a cohort. See
:ref:`instructor_cohort_events`.

**Event Source**: Server

*********************************

When a user is added to a cohort, the server emits an
``edx.cohort.user_added`` event. Members of the course team can add users to
cohorts individually or by uploading a .csv file of student cohort
assignments. The system automatically adds a user to the default cohort or a
cohort included in the course's ``auto_cohort_groups`` setting if a user who
has not yet been assigned to a cohort accesses course content.

Additional events are emitted when members of the course team interact with the
Instructor Dashboard to add a user to a cohort. See
:ref:`instructor_cohort_events`.

Teams-Related Events
==========================

This section includes descriptions of the following events, which are
generated if a course includes teams, and learners or course team members
perform particular teams-related actions. This list includes both student
events and course team events, because some of these events are triggered by
actions that can be performed both by students and course staff (with the
Staff, Admin, Discussion Admin or Discussion Moderator roles), or by students
with special roles such as Community TAs.

This section presents teams-related events alphabetically. Typically, the
first event produced when teams are included in a course is the
``edx.team.created`` event.

.. Commenting out badging events; add back when Badging supported on edx.org

  .. _badging_events:

  =================================
  Badging Events
  =================================

  This section includes descriptions of the following events related to badges,
  which are created when learners have achieved some course milestone, usually
  the awarding of a course certificate. Badges are created automatically when
  certificates are generated. A badge is uniquely identifiable by its assertion
  information. A badge assertion represents a badge being awarded to a learner,
  and describes the following three items.

       * Who the badge was awarded to.
       * What the badge represents (for example, course identifier, enrollment mode).
       * Who issued the badge (the issuing organization).

      When learners earn badges, they can download a badge image and share it on
      social networks or on badge display sites such as Mozilla Backpack. When
      other parties visit the shared badge links, they can view information that
      gives evidence of the learner's achievement.


      * ``edx.badge.assertion.created``
      * ``edx.badge.assertion.shared``
      * ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited``


      ``edx.badge.assertion.created``
      *********************************

      When a badge is created that associates a specific learner with a specific
      achievement, the server emits an ``edx.badge.assertion.created`` event.

         * - ``assertion_image_url``
           - string
           - The URL of an image file of the badge that includes badge assertion
             information in the header. These files can serve to verify the user's
             accomplishment and can be easily shared.
         * - ``assertion_json_url``
           - string
           - The URL of a JSON object containing the badge assertion information.

      ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited``
      *****************************************

      Each badge contains assertion information that includes an "evidence" field.
      When badges are displayed on sites such as Mozilla Backpack, the evidence
      field is used to provide a link to evidence that confirms the badge owner's
      achievement, usually a certificate.

      When other users visit social networks or a site such as Mozilla Backpack and
      use a badge's evidence link to view a badge owner's certificate, the server
      emits an ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited`` event.

.. _instructor_enrollment:

=============================
Instructor Enrollment Events
=============================

In addition to the enrollment events that are generated when students enroll in
or unenroll from a course, actions by course team members also generate
enrollment events.

* When a course author creates a course, his or her user account is enrolled in
  the course and the server emits an ``edx.course.enrollment.activated`` event.

* When a user with the Admin or Staff role enrolls in a course, the
  server emits ``edx.course.enrollment.activated``. The server emits
  ``edx.course.enrollment.deactivated`` events when these users unenroll from a
  course.

* When a user with the Admin or Staff role uses the **Batch Enrollment**
  feature to enroll students or other course team members in a course, the
  server emits an ``edx.course.enrollment.activated`` event for each
  enrollment. When this feature is used to unenroll students from a course, the
  server emits a ``edx.course.enrollment.deactivated`` for each unenrollment.

  For events emitted as a result of a batch enrollment, the ``username`` and
  ``context.user_id`` identify the course team member who made the change, and
  the ``event.user_id`` identifies the student who was enrolled or unenrolled.

For details about the enrollment events, see :ref:`enrollment`.

.. _instructor_cohort_events:

=============================
Course Team Cohort Events
=============================

In addition to the cohort events that are generated when cohorts are created
and users are assigned to them (see :ref:`student_cohort_events`), actions by
course team members also generate cohort-related events.

For more information about student cohorts, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Cohorts Overview` in the *Building and Running an edX
Course* guide.
