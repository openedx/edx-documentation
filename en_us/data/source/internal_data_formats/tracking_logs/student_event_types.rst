The descriptions that follow include what each event represents, the system
component it originates from, the history of any changes made to the event
over time, and any additional member fields that the common ``context`` or
``event`` fields contain.

The value in the ``event_source`` field distinguishes between events that
originate in the browser (in JavaScript) and events that originate on the
server (during the processing of a request).

  *****************
  Badging Events
  *****************

  This section includes descriptions of the following events related to badges,
  which are created when learners have achieved some course milestone, usually
  the awarding of a course certificate. Badges are created automatically when
  certificates are generated. A badge is uniquely identifiable by its assertion
  information. A badge assertion represents a badge being awarded to a learner,
  and describes the following three items.

       * Who the badge was awarded to.
       * What the badge represents (for example, course identifier, enrollment mode).
       * Who issued the badge (the issuing organization).

      When learners earn badges, they can download a badge image and share it on
      social networks or on badge display sites such as Mozilla Backpack. When
      other parties visit the shared badge links, they can view information that
      gives evidence of the learner's achievement.


      * ``edx.badge.assertion.created``
      * ``edx.badge.assertion.shared``
      * ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited``

      =================================
      ``edx.badge.assertion.created``
      =================================

      When a badge is created that associates a specific learner with a specific
      achievement, the server emits an ``edx.badge.assertion.created`` event.

           - string
           - The URL of an image file of the badge that includes badge assertion
             information in the header. These files can serve to verify the user's
             accomplishment and can be easily shared.
         * - ``assertion_json_url``
           - string
           - The URL of a JSON object containing the badge assertion information.

      =================================
      ``edx.badge.assertion.shared``
      =================================

      When a learner downloads a badge that she has earned for the purpose of
      sharing it on social media, the server emits an
      ``edx.badge.assertion.shared`` event.

      **Event Source**: Browser

      **History** Added 8 June 2015.

      ``event`` **Member Fields**:

      The ``edx.badge.assertion.shared`` event includes many of the same ``event``
      member fields that are described for the ``edx.badge.assertion.created``
      event. The following member fields serve the same purpose for
      ``edx.badge.assertion.shared`` as they do for
      ``edx.badge.assertion.created``.

      * ``assertion_id``
      * ``assertion_image_url``
      * ``assertion_json_url``
      * ``course_id``

      ===========================================================
      ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited``
      ===========================================================

      Each badge contains assertion information that includes an "evidence" field.
      When badges are displayed on sites such as Mozilla Backpack, the evidence
      field is used to provide a link to evidence that confirms the badge owner's
      achievement, usually a certificate.

      When other users visit social networks or a site such as Mozilla Backpack and
      use a badge's evidence link to view a badge owner's certificate, the server
      emits an ``edx.badge.assertion.evidence_visited`` event.

=================================
``edx.cohort.created``
=================================

When a course team or the system creates a cohort, the server emits an
``edx.cohort.created`` event. Cohorts can be created manually by members of the
course team. The system automatically creates the default cohort and any
cohorts that are defined by the ``auto_cohort_groups`` advanced setting when
they are needed (for example, when a student is assigned to one of those
cohorts).

Additional events are emitted when members of the course team select
**Instructor** in the LMS to create a cohort on the instructor dashboard. See
:ref:`instructor_cohort_events`.

=================================

When a user is added to a cohort, the server emits an ``edx.cohort.user_added``
event. Members of the course team can add users to cohorts individually or by
uploading a .csv file of student cohort assignments. The system automatically
adds a user to the default cohort or a cohort included in the course's
``auto_cohort_groups`` setting if a user who has not yet been assigned to a
cohort accesses course content.

Additional events are emitted when members of the course team select
**Instructor** in the LMS to add a user to a cohort on the instructor
dashboard. See :ref:`instructor_cohort_events`.

.. _Course Content Completion Events:

************************************
Course Content Completion Event
************************************

This section describes the event emitted by the completion XBlock, which adds
a toggle control in course content. This toggle allows learners to mark the
associated section of course content as complete.

EdX recommends using the completion XBlock primarily for progress tracking of
ungraded activities, such as reading assigned texts, watching videos, or
participating in course discussions.

Learners are not limited in the number of times that they can toggle the
control between the default incomplete state and the completed state. For more
information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:completion` in the *Building and
Running an edX Course* guide.

=======================================================
``edx.done.toggled``
=======================================================

Both the browser and the server emit the ``edx.done.toggled`` event when the
control added by the Completion XBlock is toggled. The ``event_source`` field
indicates whether the event was emitted by the client or the server.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``done``
     - Boolean
     - Indicates the state of the Completion toggle at the time the event is
       emitted. Possible values are ``true`` (a learner has completed the
       associated content) and ``false`` (a learner has not completed the
       associated content).


.. _library_events:

************************************
Content Library Interaction Events
************************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

Course teams in an organization can collaboratively contribute to content
libraries, such as a collection of problem components for a particular subject.
Content libraries are created and maintained separately from courses so that
their content can be used in different courses.

In a course outline, course teams can include randomized content block
components that reference a content library and deliver its content to
students. In a randomized content block component, the course team defines the
type and number of content library components to deliver to each student.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Content Libraries`.


=====================================================
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned``
=====================================================

The server emits an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event the
first time that content from a randomized content block is delivered to a
user. The ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event identifies the
components delivered from the library to a user.

Additional ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events can also be
emitted if the course team makes a change that results in an increase in the
number of components that the randomized content block delivers. After such a
change, the randomized content block delivers more components to any user who
revisits it after that change. For those users, the
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` event identifies the complete set
of components delivered from the library and also the components that were
delivered for the first time.

**Event Source**: Server

**History** Added 18 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``added``
     - list
     - Lists the library components that were delivered to the user for the
       first time. The content of this field is different from the content of
       the ``result`` field only if the user revisited the randomized content
       block and it delivered additional components from the library.
   * - ``location``
     - string
     - Identifies the randomized content block component.
   * - ``max_count``
     - number
     - The **Count** specified by a course team member in Studio. Defines the
       number of library components to deliver. This number is greater than
       the number of library components listed by the ``result`` field only
       when the library has too few matching blocks available.
   * - ``previous_count``
     - number
     - The number of components assigned to this student before this event.
       The first time the user views the randomized content block, this value
       is 0.
   * - ``result``
     - list
     - Lists all of the library components delivered to the user.

       * ``descendants``, when present, is a list that identifies each
         part of a library component that contains multiple parts (the
         children of an XBlock with children).

       * ``original_usage_key`` and ``original_usage_version`` identify the
         component in the library.

         When students attempt a problem component delivered by a randomized
         content block, the resulting problem events also reference the
         ``original_usage_key`` and ``original_usage_version`` in
         ``context.module`` member fields. See :ref:`context`.

       * ``usage_key`` identifies the location of this component in the
         course. This value identifies a child of the randomized
         content block component.

       To identify a component consistently within a course, you can use
       either ``usage_key`` or ``original_usage_key`` as a consistent
       identifier. To identify components across courses, use
       ``orignal_usage_key``.

=====================================================
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed``
=====================================================

The server emits an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` event when a
user revisits a randomized content block and one or more of the components
that were previously delivered to that user can no longer be delivered.

* If components are removed from the library and the course team
  resynchronizes the randomized content block to the library, the server emits
  an ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` event if a user who was
  previously assigned one of those components revisits the randomized content
  block or accesses the progress page.

* If the course team changes settings for the randomized content block so that
  fewer or different components are allowed.

  For example, the course team reduces the number of library components to
  deliver or specifies a different type of problem to deliver.

**Event Source**: Server

**History** Added 18 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` events include the following
``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for events of
this type as for the ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events.

* ``location``
* ``max_count``
* ``previous_count``
* ``result``

The following additional ``event`` member fields apply specifically to
``edx.librarycontentblock.content.removed`` events.

   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``reason``
     - string
     - 'overlimit' if a course team member reduces the **Count** of library
       components to deliver.

       'invalid' if the component is no longer included in the library, or no
       longer matches the settings specified for the randomized content block.

   * - ``removed``
     - list
     - Identifies the components that are no longer delivered to this user.
       This field contains the same member fields as the ``event.result``
       field for ``edx.librarycontentblock.content.assigned`` events.

Example ``edx.ui.lms.outline.selected`` Event
================================================

The following example shows the relevant fields of the event that is emitted
when a user selects a subsection on the course navigation pane in the LMS.

.. code-block:: json

     "name": "edx.ui.lms.outline.selected",
     "event_type": "edx.ui.lms.outline.selected",
     "event": {

         }
 }


================================================
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected``
================================================

The browser emits this event when a user selects the "next" control in the
unit navigation bar in the LMS. Users can use the "next" control to navigate
from one unit to the next unit within the current subsection, or from the last
unit in one subsection to the first unit in the next subsection.

**History** : On May 3, 2016, the "next" navigation control in the LMS was
enhanced to allow users to move not only within a subsection but also between
subsections. The ``seq_next`` event was correspondingly enhanced with
additional fields and now maps to the new event
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected``. Before May 3, 2016, the ``name`` and
``event`` fields for the ``seq_next`` event were both set to the same value.
Events that have both a ``name`` and an ``event_type`` of ``seq_next`` are no
longer emitted.

The new event with a ``name`` value of ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected``
is emitted when users navigate in the LMS using the "next" control. Depending
on whether a learner navigates within the current subsection or between
subsections, the resulting event has a different ``event_type`` value.

* Navigating to the next unit within a subsection (the already supported
  interaction that previously emitted the ``seq_next`` event) now emits the
  new event with an ``event_type`` of ``seq_next``, so that you can continue
  to track the same interaction.

* Navigating from the last unit in one subsection to the first unit in the
  next subsection, which is the newly supported interaction, emits the new
  event with both an ``event_type`` and ``name`` of
  ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected``.


**Component**: Sequence

**Event Source**: Browser

The ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected`` event includes both a ``name`` field
and an ``event_type`` field. For more information about these common fields,
see :ref:`common`.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details

   * - ``current_tab``
     - integer
     - Identifies the tab or icon in the unit navigation bar that the user was
       viewing prior to selecting "next". Tabs correspond to the unit in the
       subsection (or verticals in the sequence) and are indexed starting from
       1. If this value is equal to ``tab_count``, the user was on the last
       vertical of the subsection.

   * - ``id``
     - string
     - The usage key of the subsection that is being navigated by the user.

   * - ``new``
     - integer
     - Identifies the tab that the user was navigating to.

       This field is included only for events that are emitted by "next"
       navigation within a subsection. These events have an ``event_type`` of
       ``seq_next`` to enable backward compatibility with the ``seq_next``
       events emitted prior to 3 May 2016.

   * - ``old``
     - integer
     - Identifies the tab that the user was navigating from.

       This field is included only for events that are emitted by "next"
       navigation within a subsection. These events have an ``event_type`` of
       ``seq_next`` to enable backward compatibility with the ``seq_next``
       events emitted prior to 3 May 2016.

       The ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected`` events emitted after 3 May
       2016 use the ``current_tab`` value to identify the user's position in
       the unit, and do not include this field.

   * - ``tab_count``
     - integer
     - The number of tabs in the unit navigation bar. This number
       matches the total number of units in the current subsection.

   * - ``widget_placement``
     - string
     - Unit navigation controls appear at the top and bottom of pages in the
       LMS. Values for this field can be "top" or "bottom", indicating the
       position on the page of the control that the user selected.

=====================================================
Example ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.next_selected`` Events

         }
 }

=====================================================
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.previous_selected``
=====================================================

The browser emits this event when a user selects the "previous" control in the
unit navigation bar in the LMS. Users can use the "previous" control to
navigate from one unit back to the previous unit within the current
subsection, or from the first unit in one subsection to the last unit in the
previous subsection.

**History** : On May 3, 2016, the "previous" navigation control in the LMS was
enhanced to allow users to move not only within a subsection but also between
subsections. The ``seq_prev`` event was correspondingly enhanced with
additional fields and now maps to the new event
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.previous_selected``. Before May 3 2016, the ``name``
and ``event`` fields for the ``seq_prev`` event were both set to the same
value. Events that have both a ``name`` and an ``event_type`` of ``seq_prev``
are no longer emitted.

After May 3 2016, an event that has a ``name`` value of
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.previous_selected`` is emitted when users navigate in
the LMS using the "previous" control. Depending on whether a learner navigates
within the current subsection or between subsections, the resulting event has
a different ``event_type`` value.

* Navigating to the previous unit within a subsection (the already supported
  interaction that previously emitted the ``seq_prev`` event) now emits the
  new event with an ``event_type`` of ``seq_prev``, so that you can continue
  to track the same interaction.

* Navigating from the first unit in one subsection to the last unit in the
  previous subsection, which is the newly supported interaction, emits the new
  event with both an ``event_type`` and ``name`` of
  ``edx.ui.lms.sequence.previous_selected``.

==========================================================
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.tab_selected``
==========================================================

The browser emits this event when a user selects any tab in the unit
navigation bar in the LMS to navigate to another unit within the subsection.
Tabs correspond to the unit in the subsection (or verticals in the sequence).

**History** : On May 3, 2016, the ``seq_goto`` event was promoted to a new
naming infrastructure and now maps to the new event
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.tab_selected``. Before May 3, 2016, the ``name`` and
``event`` fields for the ``seq_goto`` event were both set to the same value.

New fields have been added to the event, but existing fields are retained for
backward compatibility. The updated event has a ``name`` value of
``edx.ui.lms.sequence.tab_selected`` and an ``event_type`` value of
``seq_goto``, to ensure that you can map these new events to the ``seq_goto``
events that were emitted previously. Events that have both a ``name`` and an
``event_type`` of ``seq_goto`` are no longer emitted.

.. _forum_events:

**************************
Discussion Forum Events
**************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1


The server emits discussion forum events when a user interacts with a course
discussion. This section presents the discussion forum events alphabetically.
However, several of these events have hierarchical or sequential
relationships.

* When a user creates a new thread, such as a student asking a question, the
  server emits an :ref:`forum_thread` event.

* When a user responds to a thread, such as another student answering the
  question, the server emits an :ref:`forum_response` event.

* When a user adds a comment to a response, such as a course team member adding
  a clarification to the student answer, the server emits an
  :ref:`forum_comment` event.

These events are emitted and included in daily event logs in addition to
the MongoDB discussion forums database data that is included in the weekly
database data files. For information about the discussion forums database, see
:ref:`Discussion Forums Data`.

If a thread, response, or comment was part of a team discussion within a
course, a ``team_id`` field is also included in events for creation or voting
interactions. The ``team_id`` identifies the team that triggered the discussion
event. For more information about events for teams, see
:ref:`student_teams_events`.

.. _forum_comment:

=====================================================
``edx.forum.comment.created``
=====================================================

Users create a comment about a response by entering text and then submitting
the contributions. When these actions are complete, the server emits an
``edx.forum.comment.created`` event.

**Component**: Discussion

**History**: Added 5 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``edx.forum.comment.created`` events include many of the same ``event``
member fields that are described for :ref:`forum_thread` and
:ref:`forum_response` events. The following member fields serve the same
purpose for comments as they do for threads or responses.

* ``body``
* ``commentable_id``
* ``discussion``
* ``id``
* ``options``
* ``team_id``
* ``truncated``
* ``url``
* ``user_course_roles``

.. _forum_response:

=====================================================
``edx.forum.response.created``
=====================================================

Users create a reply to a post by clicking **Add a Response** and then
submitting their contributions. When these actions are complete, the server
emits an ``edx.forum.response.created`` event.

**Component**: Discussion

**Event Source**: Server

**History**: Added 5 Mar 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``edx.forum.response.created`` events include many of the same ``event``
member fields that are described for :ref:`forum_thread` events. The following
member fields serve the same purpose for responses as they do for threads.

* ``body``
* ``commentable_id``
* ``id``
* ``options``
* ``team_id``
* ``truncated``
* ``url``
* ``user_course_roles``
* ``user_forums_roles``

The following additional ``event`` member field applies specifically to
``edx.forum.response.created`` events.

=====================================================
``edx.forum.response.voted``
=====================================================

Users can indicate interest in a response by selecting a "Vote" icon. The
"Vote" icon is a toggle, so users can also clear a vote made previously. When
either of these actions is complete, the server emits an
``edx.forum.response.voted`` event.

In these events, the user who voted for the response is identified in the
``username`` and ``context.user_id`` fields, and the user who originally posted
the thread is identified in the ``event.target_username`` field.

**Component**: Discussion

**Event Source**: Server

**History**: Added 1 Dec 2015.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``edx.forum.response.voted`` events include the same ``event`` member
fields as :ref:`edx.forum.thread.voted` events. The following member fields
serve the same purpose for votes on a response as they do for votes on a
thread.

* ``category_id``
* ``category_name``
* ``commentable_id``
* ``id``
* ``target_username``
* ``team_id``
* ``undo_vote``

``edx.forum.searched``
=====================================================

After a user executes a text search in the navigation sidebar of the course
**Discussion** page, the server emits an ``edx.forum.searched`` event.

**Component**: Discussion

**Event Source**: Server

**History**: Added 16 May 2014.  The ``corrected_text`` field was added 5
Jun 2014. The ``group_id`` field was added 7 October 2014.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Details
   * - ``corrected_text``
     - string
     - A re-spelling of the query, suggested by the search engine, which was
       automatically substituted for the original one.

       This happens only when there are no results for the original query, but
       the index contains matches for a similar term or phrase.

       Otherwise, this field is null.

   * - ``group_id``
     - number
     - The numeric ID of the cohort to which the user's search is
       restricted, or ``null`` if the search is not restricted in this way.

       In a course with cohorts enabled, a student's searches will always be
       restricted to the student's cohort.

       Discussion admins, moderators, and Community TAs in such a course can
       search all discussions without specifying a cohort, which leaves
       this field ``null``, or they can specify a single cohort to
       search.

   * - ``page``
     - number
     - Results are returned in sets of 20 per page.

       Identifies the page of results requested by the user.

.. _Drag and Drop Events:

***********************
Drag and Drop Events
***********************

This section describes events emitted by the drag and drop problem XBlock. The
drag and drop problem XBlock presents a background image and a set of draggable
items. Learners select an item and move it into a target zone on the background
image. Drag and drop problems can also require that learners enter number input
for each item that they drag into a target zone. A drag and drop problem is
complete when each draggable item that matches a target zone is correctly
placed on its zone.

For more information about how course teams set up a drag and drop problem, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem`.

Open Response Assessment Events
**************************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

In an open response assessment, learners review a question and then submit a
text response and, optionally, an image, .pdf, or other file. To evaluate
their own and one or more other learners' responses to the questions, learners
use a scoring rubric designed by the course team. Course team members with
staff privileges can also evaluate learners' responses, either in a staff
assessment step included in the assignment, or by overriding an existing
assignment score. For more information about open response assessments, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Open Response Assessments 2`.

For more information about the SQL tables that store data for open assessment
problems, see :ref:`ORA2 Data`.

**Component**: Open Response Assessments

**History:** The open response assessment feature was released in August 2014;
limited release of this feature began in April 2014. The ability for course
team members to either include a staff assessment step in the assignment, or
to perform a staff override grade, was added in January 2016.

=====================================================
``openassessmentblock.get_peer_submission``
=====================================================

After learners submit their own responses for evaluation, they use the scoring
rubric to evaluate the responses of other course participants. The server emits
this event when a response is delivered to a learner for evaluation.

:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Problem Components` in the *Building and
Running an edX Course* guide.

These events were designed for the problem types implemented in the edX
platform by the ``capa_module.py`` XBlock. Problem types that are implemented
by other XBlocks, such as :ref:`open response assessments<ora2>`,
:ref:`peer instruction assessments<Peer Instruction Events>`,
:ref:`drag and drop problems<Drag and Drop Events>`, or
:ref:`polls and surveys<Poll and Survey Events>`, are instrumented with
different events.

For information about designing problems to include hints, feedback, or
both, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding Feedback and Hints to a Problem` in
the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

===============================================
``edx.problem.hint.demandhint_displayed``
===============================================

Course teams can design problems to include one or more hints. For problems
that include hints, the server emits an
``edx.problem.hint.demandhint_displayed`` event each time a user requests a
hint.

**Event Source**: Server

**History**: This event was added on 1 Jul 2015.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

This event type includes the :ref:`common<context>` ``context.module`` member
field.

       Hints to a Problem` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

=================
``problem_check``
=================

The server emits ``problem_check`` events when a problem is successfully
checked.

Teams-Related Events
**************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events, which are
generated if a course includes teams, and learners or course team members
perform particular teams-related actions. This list includes both student
events and course team events, because some of these events are triggered by
actions that can be performed both by students and course staff (with the
Staff, Admin, Discussion Admin or Discussion Moderator roles), or by students
with special roles such as Community TAs.

This section presents teams-related events alphabetically. Typically, the
first event produced when teams are included in a course is the
``edx.team.created`` event.

Testing Events for Content Experiments
***************************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

Course authors can configure course content to present modules that contain
other modules. Content experiments, also known as A/B or split tests, use this
structure. For example, a parent module can include two child modules that
contain content that differs in some way for comparison testing.

* Internally, a *partition* defines the type of experiment: comparing the
  effectiveness of video alone to text alone, for example. A course can include
  any number of modules that have the same partition or experiment type.

* For each partition, students are randomly assigned to a *group*. The group
  determines which content, either video or text in this example, is shown by
  every module with that partitioning.

* Students are assigned to groups randomly. Assignment to a group takes place
  when student navigation through the course requires data from that module.
  For example, one student is assigned to a group when he visits the course
  progress page, while another student is assigned to a group when she visits a
  course component that is the parent module of a content experiment. Based on
  this random group assignment, the content of just one of the two child
  modules is shown to the student.

* For investigations into which students in each group actually interacted with
  tested content, review the events for the behavior you want to learn about.
  For example, review the students' ``play_video`` ,
  ``textbook.pdf.page.navigated``, or ``problem_check`` events.

The events that follow apply to modules that are set up to randomly assign
students to groups so that different content can be shown to the different
groups.

For more information about how course teams add content experiments to their
courses, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Add Content Experiments to Your Course`.

**History**: These events were added on 12 Mar 2014.

=================================================
``xmodule.partitions.assigned_user_to_partition``
=================================================

When a student views a module that is set up to test different child modules,
the server checks the ``user_api_usercoursetag`` table for the student's
assignment to the relevant partition, and to a group for that partition.

* The partition ID is the ``user_api_usercoursetag.key``.

* The group ID is the ``user_api_usercoursetag.value``.

If the student does not yet have an assignment, the server emits an
``xmodule.partitions.assigned_user_to_partition`` event and adds a row to the
``user_api_usercoursetag`` table for the student. See
:ref:`user_api_usercoursetag`.

.. note:: After this event is emitted, the common ``context`` field in all
 subsequent events includes a ``course_user_tags`` member field with the
 student's assigned partition and group.

=================================================
``xblock.split_test.child_render``
=================================================

When a student views a module that is set up to test different content using
child modules, the server emits a ``xblock.split_test.child_render`` event to
identify the child module that was shown to the student.

*************************************
Timed Exam and Proctored Exam Events
*************************************

Special exams are a type of course exam that includes timed exams, proctored
exams, and practice proctored exams. These exam types offer more complicated
functionality than other assignment types in graded subsections, and they emit
additional events. Special exam events provide information about special exams
included in courses and learners' interactions with those special exams.

* Proctored exams have a time limit and they require learners to install and
  run monitoring software while taking the exam. After a learner completes a
  proctored exam, a team of reviewers determines whether the learner complied
  with all of the exam rules based on records generated by the monitoring
  software.

* Practice proctored exams allow learners to become familiar with the
  monitoring software that they will use during an actual proctored exam. The
  way that a learner experiences a practice proctored exam is identical to a
  proctored exam. In a practice proctored exam, the monitoring software does
  not send exam records to reviewers.

* Timed exams have a time limit. Learners do not install or use monitoring
  software when they take a timed exam.

Practice proctored exams follow a workflow that is similar to proctored exams
but do not include a review of the exam attempt. Timed exams also follow a
similar workflow but do not include any proctoring software or review of the
exam attempt.

The following diagram shows the workflow for a proctored exam.

  :alt: A diagram showing the workflow for a proctored exam.

For more information about timed exams and proctored exams, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Timed Exams` and
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:CA_ProctoredExams_Overview`.

Some special exam events are emitted when course teams develop and administer
exams. For more information, see :ref:`special_exam_development_events`.

Because special exams include similar functions and behavior, they share some
similar events. For example, the
``edx.special_exam.proctored.allowance.created``,
``edx.special_exam.practice.allowance.created``, and
``edx.special_exam.timed.allowance.created`` events include identical fields.

This section includes descriptions of the following events.

Video Interaction Events
*********************************

This section includes descriptions of the following events. Due to a naming
convention change, many of these events have two identifying names. In this
list, the original name, which is present in the ``event_type`` field for all
events, is followed by a newer, revised name. The revised name is present in
the ``name`` field only for events that have an ``event_source`` of 'mobile'.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

A browser or the edX mobile app emits video interaction events when a user
interacts with a video.

* When users use a browser to stream video files on a desktop computer or
  mobile device, the browser emits the events.

* When users use the edX mobile app to stream or download course videos for
  offline viewing, the mobile app emits the events.

  When a user interacts with a downloaded video file offline using the edX
  mobile app, note that the app can only forward its events during the next
  connection opportunity. As a result, the date and time in the event's
  ``time`` field can be different from the date and time in its
  ``context.received_at`` field. Data packages can include events emitted on
  past dates.

This section presents the video interaction events alphabetically. Typically,
an interaction with the video player begins with a :ref:`play_video` event.

For courses that include a pre-roll video, user interactions with the pre-roll
video result in different events. For more information, see :ref:`pre-roll`.

**Component**: Video

**History**: The edX mobile app for iOS began to emit a subset of the video
events on 25 Feb 2015. The edX mobile app for Android began to emit a subset
of the video events on 23 Dec 2014.

==========================================================
``hide_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.hidden``
==========================================================

When a user toggles **Show Transcript** to suppress display of the video transcript, the
browser or mobile app emits a ``hide_transcript`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``hide_transcript``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.transcript.hidden``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for iOS. Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for

following ``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for
events of this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``id``
* ``current_time``

==========================================================
``edx.video.closed_captions.shown``
==========================================================

When a user toggles **CC** to display the closed captions, the browser or
mobile app emits an ``edx.video.closed_captions.shown`` event.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Added on 5 May 2016 to include this new event.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include

following ``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for
events of this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``id``
* ``current_time``

==========================================================
``load_video``/``edx.video.loaded``
==========================================================

When the video is fully rendered and ready to play, the browser or mobile app
emits a ``load_video`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``load_video``, the events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.loaded``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for iOS. Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for

member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for events of this type as
for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``id``

==========================================================
``pause_video``/``edx.video.paused``
==========================================================

When a user selects the video player's **pause** control, the player emits a
``pause_video`` event. For videos that are streamed in a browser, when the
player reaches the end of the video file and play automatically stops it emits
both this event and a ``stop_video`` event (as of June 2014).

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Stop Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Stop Time** is
  present for the video, the player stops at the specified time and emits the
  ``pause_video`` and ``stop_video`` events.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in the edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Stop Time** and plays the file to its end. The app
  then emits only the ``stop_video`` event.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video
Components` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``pause_video``, the events
that the edX mobile app emits include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.paused``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**:

* Updated 5 May 2015 to include the effect of a **Video Stop Time**.

this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``currentTime``: The time in the video at which the video paused.
* ``id``

.. _play_video:

==========================================================
``play_video``/``edx.video.played``
==========================================================

When a user selects the video player's **play** control, the player emits a
``play_video`` event.

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Start Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Start Time** is
  present for the video, the player starts at the specified time and emits the
  ``play_video`` event.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in the edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Start Time** and emits the ``play_video`` event
  when it plays the file from the beginning.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video
Components` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``play_video``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.played``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**:

* Updated 5 May 2015 to include the effect of a **Video Start Time**.
* Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile app for iOS.
* Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile app for
  Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. Other video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of
mobile also include these fields. For an example of an event with these
fields, see :ref:`Example Mobile App Event`.

       **History**: In October 2014, identifiers for some new courses began to
       use the format shown above. Other new courses, and all courses created
       prior to October 2014, use an HTML-escaped version of the
       ``courseware_studentmodule.module_id``. For example,
       ``i4x-HarvardX-PH207x-video-Simple_Random_Sample``.

==========================================================
``seek_video``/``edx.video.position.changed``
==========================================================

A browser emits ``seek_video`` events when a user selects a user interface
control to go to a different point in the video file.

* On a desktop computer, users can click and drag in the playback bar or click
  in a transcript to change position.
* In the edX mobile app, users can click and drag in the playback bar or tap
  the "back 30 seconds" button to change position.
* When using a browser on a mobile device, users can click and drag in the
  playback bar to change position.

In addition to the value ``seek_video`` in the ``event_type`` field, the
events that the edX mobile app emits include the value
``edx.video.position.changed`` in the ``name`` field.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**:

* Updated 10 Mar 2015 to include the final implementation for events emitted
  by the edX mobile app for Android and iOS. Prototype events were emitted by
  the mobile app in February and March 2015.

* Prior to 25 Jun 2014, the ``old_time`` and ``new_time`` fields were set to
  the same value.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for
``seek_video``/ ``edx.video.position.changed`` events as for
:ref:`play_video`. For an example of an event with these fields, see
:ref:`Example Mobile App Event`.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``seek_video``/``edx.video.position.changed`` events include the following
``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for events of
this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``id``

The following additional ``event`` member fields apply specifically to
``seek_video``/``edx.video.position.changed`` events.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60

       destination point.
   * - ``old_time``
     - number
     - The time in the video, in seconds, at which the user chose to go to a
       different point in the file.
   * - ``requested_skip_interval``
     - number
     - Applies only to events with an  ``event_source`` of 'mobile'. The number
       of seconds that the user moved backward (expressed as a negative) or
       forward in the file.

       **History**: Added 10 Mar 2015.

   * - ``type``
     - string
     - The navigational method used to change position within the video.

       In events for a user of a desktop computer, this value can be
       'onCaptionSeek' or 'onSlideSeek'. In events for a user of the mobile
       app, this value can be 'onSlideSeek' or 'onSkipSeek'.

==========================================================
``show_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.shown``
==========================================================

When a user toggles **Show Transcript** to display the video transcript, the browser or
mobile app emits a ``show_transcript`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``show_transcript``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.transcript.shown``.

**Event Source**: Browser or Mobile

**History**: Updated 25 Feb 2015 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for iOS. Updated 23 Dec 2014 to include events emitted by the edX mobile
app for Android.

``context`` **Member Fields**:

Only video interaction events with an ``event_source`` of 'mobile' include
additional ``context`` member fields in addition to the :ref:`common<context>`
member fields. The same set of additional context fields are added for

:ref:`play_video`. For an example of an event with these fields, see
:ref:`Example Mobile App Event`.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

The ``show_transcript``/``edx.video.transcript.shown`` events include the
following ``event`` member fields. These fields serve the same purpose for
events of this type as for the :ref:`play_video` events.

* ``code``
* ``currentTime``: The point in the video file at which the transcript was
  opened.
* ``id``

==========================================================
``speed_change_video``
==========================================================

A browser emits ``speed_change_video`` events when a user selects a different
playing speed for the video.

**Event Source**: Browser

**History**: Prior to 12 Feb 2014, this event was emitted when a user
selected either the same speed or a different speed.

``event`` **Member Fields**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 15 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type

       '1.25', '1.50'.
   * - ``old_speed``
     - number
     - The speed at which the video was playing.

==========================================================
``stop_video``/``edx.video.stopped``
==========================================================

When the video player reaches the end of the video file and play automatically
stops, the player emits a ``stop_video`` event.

Note that course teams can specify a **Video Stop Time** for video files.

* If the user streams a video file in a browser and a **Video Stop Time** is
  present for the video, the player stops at the specified time and emits the
  ``pause_video`` and ``stop_video`` events.

* If the user plays a streaming or downloaded video in edX mobile app, the
  app ignores the **Video Stop Time** and plays the file to its end. The
  app then emits the ``stop_video`` event.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video
Components` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``stop_video``, the events
that the edX mobile app emits include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.stopped``.

* ``id``

==========================================================
``video_hide_cc_menu``/``edx.video.language_menu.hidden``
==========================================================

When a user closes the **Language Menu** for a video that
has transcripts in multiple languages, the browser emits a
``video_hide_cc_menu`` event.

In addition to the identifying ``event_type`` of ``video_hide_cc_menu``, events
that the edX mobile app emits also include a ``name`` field with a value of
``edx.video.language_menu.hidden`` and the selected language is included in the
event.

**Event Source**: Browser

**History**: Updated 5 May 2016 to include the ``name`` value. Note that older
tracking logs will only utilize the ``event_type`` value. Also note that from
Fall 2015 until 5 May 2016, this event was emitted incorrectly. Events may
have been emitted even when the language menu was not triggered.
Added 17 Feb 2015.
