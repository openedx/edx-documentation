Special exams are a type of course exam that includes timed exams, proctored
exams, and practice proctored exams. These exam types offer more complicated
functionality than other assignment types in graded subsections, and they emit
additional events. Special exam events provide information about special exams
included in courses and learners' interactions with those special exams.

* Proctored exams have a time limit and they require learners to install and
  run monitoring software while taking the exam. After a learner completes a
  proctored exam, a team of reviewers determines whether the learner complied
  with all of the exam rules based on records generated by the monitoring
  software.

* Practice proctored exams allow learners to become familiar with the
  monitoring software that they will use during an actual proctored exam. The
  way that a learner experiences a practice proctored exam is identical to a
  proctored exam. In a practice proctored exam, the monitoring software does
  not send exam records to reviewers.

* Timed exams have a time limit. Learners do not install or use monitoring
  software when they take a timed exam.

Practice proctored exams follow a workflow that is similar to proctored exams
but do not include a review of the exam attempt. Timed exams also follow a
similar workflow but do not include any proctoring software or review of the
exam attempt.

The following diagram shows the workflow for a proctored exam.
