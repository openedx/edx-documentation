Open Response Assessment Data
##############################

This section describes the data schema for the edX open response assessment
(ORA) system.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

The schema includes a number of tables, and the ORA system offers a range of
uses. As a result, the data can be complex. EdX recommends that you set up a
course on a devstack instance so that you can create assessments and test the
possible learner interactions.

* For more information about how course teams can set up open response
  assessments, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:PA Create an ORA Assignment`.

* For more information about how learners respond to these assessments, see
  :ref:`learners:SFD_ORA`.

* For more information about setting up a devstack Vagrant instance, see
  :ref:`installation:Installing the Open edX Developer Stack`.

**History**:  These tables were added to the ``ora`` subdirectory of the
``{org}-{date}.zip`` database data file in data packages beginning with the 13
Dec 2015 export. The data in these tables is for the current, fully supported
version of the open response assessment feature. Data for the initial
version (which was deprecated in May 2014) is not included.

********************
Workflow Tables
********************

The ORA workflow tables store data about a response that a learner has
submitted as it goes through each of the steps defined for the ORA component.

The top level table is ``AssessmentWorkflow``, which specifies the steps that a
learner must complete for the ORA component.

.. V is this accurate?

The self assessment step in an ORA component is a required, single step
process. The ``AssessmentWorkflowStep`` table stores data about this step. A
component can also include a training step, a peer evaluation step, or both.
Additional tables store data for these optional steps.

* ``StudentTrainingWorkflow`` stores data about a learner's evaluation of a set
  of instructor-provided samples, including what evaluations the learner has
  completed and when each evaluation was made.

* ``PeerWorkflow`` stores data about the progress of a response as it undergoes
  peer grading, which can involve input from one or more peers.

*******************************
Assessment and Rubric Tables
*******************************

The assessment tables store the assessments that have been made for a
particular response. Assessments can be self assessments, submitted by
learners about their own work, or peer assessments, which are submitted by
other learners. Assessments are scored against rubrics.

A ``Rubric`` specifies guidelines on how to assess submissions. Each rubric
consists of a set of ``Criterion`` entries, each of which has a set of
``CriterionOptions``.

For example, a criterion for assessing writing might be, "The essay is well
structured". The options that a learner can choose for that criterion might be,
"No evidence of structure; rambles", "There is an attempt at organizing the
material, but it doesn't flow very well", and "Clear structure from beginning
to end".

The data for a rubric is written to these tables at the time of assessment. If
a course team makes a change to the rubric for a problem, these tables contain
different entries for assessments that were done before, and after, the change.

******************************************
Submission, StudentItem, and Score Tables
******************************************

The ``Submission`` table represents the responses made by a learner for a given
component in a given course. Depending on the configuration of the ORA
component, a learner can contribute multiple submissions for a given problem.

.. note:: The ``Submission`` table includes only text responses. The data
  package does not include files uploaded by learners to accompany their text
  responses.

The ``StudentItem`` table identifies a learner and the ORA component in the
course. Rows in this table are linked to all submissions made by that learner
for that component, as well as to each ``Score`` for that component.

*************
Detailed ERD
*************

This entity relationship diagram (ERD) provides a reference for the
tables involved, their columns, and their relationships.

Some of the tables modeled in this diagram have many to many relationships, in
which case there is an additional table that stores data to reflect those
relationships. An example is the
``assessment_trainingexample_options_selected`` table for the relationship
between the ``CriterionOption`` and ``TrainingExample`` tables, identified on
the diagram by ``options_selected (trainingexample)``.

Notes
======

* Anonymous learner IDs are used throughout the ORA2 data. To link to full user
  data, you must join to the ``student_anonymoususerid`` table. For more
  information, see :ref:`student_anonymoususerid`.

* The ERD includes several tables that include ``AI`` in the name. These tables
  were used for an edX prototype of an example based assessment system. That
  prototype system is not yet in general use, so the edX data packages do not
  include these tables.
