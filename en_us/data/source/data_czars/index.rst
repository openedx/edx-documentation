Data Czars at Partner Institutions
###################################

A data czar is the single representative at a partner institution who has the
credentials to download and decrypt edX data packages. The data czar is
responsible for transferring data securely to researchers and other interested
parties after it is received. Due to the sensitivity of this data, the
responsibility for these activities is restricted to one individual.

At each partner institution, the data czar is the primary point of contact for
information about edX data.
