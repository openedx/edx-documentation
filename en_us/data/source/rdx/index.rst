#############################################
Using the Research Data Exchange Data Package
#############################################

The edX research data exchange (RDX) program enables researchers at
participating partner institutions to request data for completed edx.org
courses.

The RDX program is a mutual exchange: only partner institutions that
choose to participate in RDX contribute data to the program, and only
researchers at those institutions can request data from the program.

Researchers at participating partner institutions must propose, and be approved
for, a specific educational research project to receive RDX data.

EdX obfuscates obvious identifiers from RDX data before it is shared. For
example, names, user names, email addresses, and IP addresses are removed from
the data. For more information, see `rdx_data`. Published studies based on RDX
data may include only aggregate data.

research project, see the `Research Data Exchange section`_ of the
