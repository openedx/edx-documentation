Using the Research Data Exchange Data Package
#############################################

The edX research data exchange (RDX) program enables researchers at
participating partner institutions to request data for completed edx.org
courses. The edX data package contains data only about one institution's
courses; an RDX data package can contain data about courses from other partner
institutions that also participate in the RDX program.

The RDX program is a mutual exchange: only partner institutions that
choose to participate in RDX contribute data to the program, and only
researchers at those institutions can request data from the program.

For information about joining the RDX program or proposing an educational
research project, see the `Research Data Exchange section`_ of the
partners.edx.org website.

Researchers at participating partner institutions must propose, and be approved
for, a specific educational research project to receive RDX data.

EdX obfuscates obvious identifiers from RDX data before it is shared. For
example, names, user names, email addresses, and IP addresses are removed from
the data. For more information, see `rdx_data`. Published studies based on RDX
data may include only aggregate data.
