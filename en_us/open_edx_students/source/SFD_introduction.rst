A Note about Time Zones 
************************

As you work through your course, you'll see dates and times when new materials
are released and when homework assignments and exams are due. It's important to
remember that edX lists all times in universal coordinated time (UTC). When you
see a time in your course, we recommend that you use a time zone converter to
convert the UTC time to your local time. You can any converter that you want,
including one of the following time zone converters.
