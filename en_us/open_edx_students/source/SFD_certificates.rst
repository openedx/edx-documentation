.. The edX Learner's Guide also includes a Certificates topic, but it has no
.. shared content with this topic and there is no "Certificates" file in the
.. Shared folder.

Your course might be set up to issue certificates as evidence that you
successfully completed the course. Different types of certificates might be
available for courses you take. For information about the certificates that
your course offers, contact the course team or institution that created your
course.

Upload a Badge to Mozilla Backpack
************************************

Some courses that offer certificates allow you to download a badge that
represents your certificate and share the badge on a badging site such as
Mozilla Backpack. You can download your badge as soon as your certificate
appears on your dashboard. Many courses distribute certificates within two
weeks of the course end date.

To share your certificate on a Mozilla badging site, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, locate the course that you want, and then select **View
   Your Certificate**.

   If this option is not available, the course might not have distributed
   certificates yet. Check your dashboard again in a few days.

#. On the certificate web page, select the badge icon.
