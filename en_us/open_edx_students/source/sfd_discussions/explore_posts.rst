Exploring Discussion Posts
###########################

Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the subject that interests you, and then reading
and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps make the
time that everyone spends with the course discussions more productive. You can
search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a single
discussion topic.

To search for posts, responses, or comments containing a particular keyword or
phrase, enter the word or phrase, or a partial word in the **Search all posts**
field at the top of the **Discussion** page.

Search results are displayed in the discussion navigation pane. If an exact
match is not found, search results are shown for a similar value.

You can also enter a username to search for posts added by a specific person.
Select the linked username in the search result to show a list of posts made by
that person. For more information about viewing contributions from a specific

View Discussions about a Specific Topic
*********************************************

Course discussions are organized by discussion topics, which are created by the
course team. Anyone who adds a post to the course discussions selects an
existing topic to associate their post with. For more information about topics,
see :ref:`Basic Elements of Course Discussions`.

You can browse discussions by topic, to join the discussion on subjects that
interest you, or to see if anyone else in the course has asked the same
question.

=======================================
View Topics on the Discussion Page
=======================================

On the **Discussion** page, you can view both course-wide and content-specific
discussions. Select **All Topics** above the discussion navigation pane to see
all of the discussion topics in the course. To see all of the posts in an
individual topic, select the topic name in the discussion navigation pane.

Note that course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them,
while content-specific topics are indented under a category name.

Content-specific topics are located in specific units in the course. They
typically appear below the content they apply to. To access a content-specific
topic, view the unit that contains the topic.
