Exploring Discussion Posts
###########################

Finding out whether someone else has already asked the same question or
initiated a conversation about the subject that interests you, and then reading
and contributing to that exchange instead of starting a new one, helps make the
time that everyone spends with the course discussions more productive. You can
search for something specific, or you can browse through the posts in a single
discussion topic.

.. _Discussion Topics:

*********************************************
View Discussions about a Specific Topic
*********************************************

Course discussions are organized by discussion topics, which are created by the
course team. Anyone who adds a post to the course discussions selects an
existing topic to associate their post with. For more information about topics,
see :ref:`Basic Elements of Course Discussions`.

You can browse discussions by topic, to join the discussion on subjects that
interest you, or to see if anyone else in the course has asked the same
question.

=======================================
View Topics on the Discussion Page
=======================================

On the **Discussion** page, select the *Topics* tab in discussion navigation pane to see
all of the discussion topics in the course. Topics tab will list course-wide discussion
topics first, followed by content-specific discussion topics. Select a topic from the list
to see all posts associated with that topic.

Note that course-wide topics do not have other topics indented below them,
while content-specific topics are indented under a category name.
You can also see the count of Discussion and Question type posts in each topic, in the topic list.

typically appear below the content they apply to. To access a content-specific
topic, view the unit that contains the topic.

   next to the above the discussion navigation pane.

   discussion inside the unit.


*****************************************
Filter or Sort Posts
*****************************************

You can filter or sort the posts in *All post*, *My post* and *Topics* tab in following ways:

1. You can filter the posts by status: *Unread*, *Following* and *Unanswered* (question type posts only).
2. You can filter the posts by type: *Discussion* or *Question*.
3. You can sort the posts by *Recent activity*, *Most activity* and *Most likes*.

By default, both types of posts are displayed, having any status and sorted by *Recent activity*.
In this context, activity means creation of the post itself or a response or comment on the post.

*****************************************
View Pinned Posts
*****************************************

Pinned posts appear at the top of the list of posts in *All posts*, *My posts* and *Topics* tab.
Pinned posts can contain important information about the course or any part of the course, such as a
particular video or problem. The pinned post can originate from anyone in the
course, including other learners or members of the discussion moderation team,
but only members of the moderation team can pin a post.
Look for the pin icon on top-right of the summary of a post to identify a pinned post.
