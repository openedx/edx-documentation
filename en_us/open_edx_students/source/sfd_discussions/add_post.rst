**************
Adding a Post
**************

When you add a post to a discussion in your course, you decide what type of
post to make and the topic of the post. For course-wide discussion topics, you
can add a post on the **Discussion** page. For content-specific discussions in
a course unit, you can add a post either on the **Discussion** page or
directly in the course unit.

.. _Determine Post Type:

**************************************************
Determining the Post Type: Discussion or Question
**************************************************

To make sure that other learners and the course team can find and respond to
your post, decide what type of post you want to make: either question or
discussion.

* A question post raises an issue so that the discussion moderation team or
  community can provide answers.

* A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and
  reflections, and inviting community participation.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion). If you are asking a question about the
course and need an answer from the course team, be sure to create your post as
a question, so that the course team sees that a response is required and
responds appropriately.

After you make your post, on the **Discussion** page for your course, a
question mark next to the avatar identifies posts that ask questions.

.. note:: You can change the post type from discussion to question or vice
   versa at any time after you add your post. For more information, see
   :ref:`Edit or Delete`.


.. _Determine Post Topic:

****************************
Determining the Post Topic
****************************

Every post in the course discussions has an associated topic. The course team
creates the list of discussion topics for each course, and you choose a
topic from that list when you create your post. Before you add a post, you
should look through the list of topics in the course discussions so that you
can decide which topic is the most appropriate for your post. For more
information, see :ref:`Explore Posts`.

After you decide on a post type and topic, you can add your post on the
**Discussion** page or in the body of the course.


.. _Add a post on discussion page:
