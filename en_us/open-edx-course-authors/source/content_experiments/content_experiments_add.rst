After you :ref:`enable content experiments <Enable Content Experiments>` and
:ref:`set up group configurations in Studio <Set up Group Configurations in edX
Studio>`, you
can add content experiments to your course. See:

* :ref:`Add a Content Experiment in Studio`
* :ref:`Add a Content Experiment in OLX`

.. _Add a Content Experiment in Studio:

********************************************
Add a Content Experiment in Studio
********************************************

You can add a content experiment in a unit or container page. In Studio, you
create and view content for all groups in the content experiment in a container
page for the experiment, as shown in `Create Content for Groups in the Content
Experiment`_.

When a student views the unit with the content experiment, she has no
indication there is a content experiment in the unit, and the content
experiment display name is not shown. She sees only the content that you
configure for the group she is assigned to. To the student, the unit with the
content experiment is no different than any other unit.

To configure a content experiment in Studio, you:

#. `Create the content experiment`_.
#. `Create content for groups in the content experiment`_.
   
After you configure a content experiment, you can change its group
configuration. See `Change the Group Configuration for a Content Experiment`_.

===============================
Create the Content Experiment
===============================

#. In the unit page, under **Add New Component**, click **Advanced**.

#. Select **Content Experiment**.
   
   A new content experiment is added to the unit:

    :width: 800

   You can work with the content experiment as you can any other component.
   See :ref:`Developing Course Components` for more information.

#. Click either **Select a Group Configuration** or **Edit** to open the content
   experiment component.

    :alt: The content experiment editor

#. Next to **Group Configuration**, select a group configuration.

#. In the **Display Name** field, enter the name that the component will use in Studio. The
   display name is only used in Studio; students do not see this value.

#. Click **Save**.

The content experiment is displayed as a component that contains other
components. See :ref:`Components that Contain Other Components` for more
information.

.. note::  You cannot duplicate a content experiment.

You can now create content for the groups in the experiment.

=====================================================
Create Content for Groups in the Content Experiment
=====================================================
   
After you select a group configuration, in the content experiment component,
click **View**.

The content experiment page that opens automatically includes a container for
each group that is defined in the group configuration you selected. For
example, if you select a group configuration that defines Group A and Group B,
you see the following page:

.. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_container.png
 :alt: The content experiment page with two groups

You add content for both groups as needed, just as you would add content to any
container page. See :ref:`Components that Contain Other Components` for more
information.

For example, you can add an HTML component and a video to Group A:

.. image:: ../Images/a_b_test_child_expanded.png
 :alt: Image of an expanded A/B test component

.. note:: 
  It is valid, and can be useful, to have no content for a group in the
  experiment.  For example, if one group has a video and another group has no
  content, you can analyze the effect of the video on student performance.


========================================================
Change the Group Configuration for a Content Experiment
========================================================

You can change the group configuration for a content experiment. When you
change the group configuration, you must add components to any new groups that you create. You
can use the components from the previous groups, as well as create new
components.

.. warning::
  Changing the group configuration of a student-visible experiment will affect
  the experiment data.

To change the group configuration:

#. Open the unit page of the unit that contains the content experiment.

#. In the content experiment component, click **Edit**.

   .. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_editor_group2.png
    :alt: The content experiment editor with a group configuration selected

#. Select a different group configuration.

#. Click **Save**.

#. You must now add components to the new groups in the experiment. Click
   **View** to open the content experiment.

   You see that groups for the new configuration are empty, and any components
   that you had added to groups in the previous configuration are now moved to
   a section called **Inactive Groups**.

   .. image:: ../Images/inactive_groups.png
    :alt: Components in inactive groups

#. Drag and drop components from the **Inactive Groups** section into the new
   groups. You can also create new components in the new groups.
