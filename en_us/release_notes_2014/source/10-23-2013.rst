=============
New Features
=============

* **Improved import experience** (STUD-595)

  When you import a course, the Import screen now provides real-time status updates. The Import screen tells you when the import is in the
  following stages:
  * Uploading
  * Unpacking
  * Verifying
  * Updated Course
  * Success (Complete)

* **Improved drag and drop experience in course outlines** (STUD-575)

  The ability to drag and drop sections, subsections, and units in the course outline is enhanced in the following ways:

  * The visual representation of where you are moving the course element to is improved, with a pointer and blue line indicating the
    new position.

  * You can more easily drag units from one subsection to another.

  * When you cancel a drop, the course element returns to its original position.

  * You can no longer drag a course element below the New Unit button, which was causing confusion.

* **Text customization capability**

  You can now customize some of the UI text that your students see. You do this through the text_customization key in the Advanced
  Settings for the course. (However, edX recommends that you contact your partner manager before you modify the text_customization key.)

* **JavaScript loading performance**

  JavaScript loading is changed in ways that should improve the performance on some pages.
  Code contributors should note that JavaScript is now loaded through require.js.
