The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of July 30,
2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

***************************************
edX Studio
***************************************

* In some versions of Internet Explorer, users could not edit plain HTML in HTML components. This problem has been fixed.

* Problem components have a new **Correct or Past Due** setting. With this setting, course staff can configure a problem so that students can only see the answer if they have answered the problem correctly or the problem's due date has passed.

***************************************
edX Website
***************************************

* On the edX.org sign-up page, the **Public Username** field is now above the **Password** field.

* In the student dashboard, the appearance of the user profile area in the left pane has changed.

  Former user profile area:

**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce two upcoming features that will release in the next few weeks:

* In Studio, new capabilities will make it easier for course authors to edit
  and publish content. We've simplified the publishing workflow and added clear
  indications to the UI so you'll know at a glance whether your content is
  published and released--and whether students can see it.

* In addition to the existing Discussion post type, course discussions will
  soon include a new Question post type. Students and course teams will also be
  able to filter posts by unanswered questions.
