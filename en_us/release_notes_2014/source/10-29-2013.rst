New Features
=============

* **New video editing interface, enabling an enhanced workflow for adding timed transcripts to videos** (BLD-238)

  When you enter a video URL in the Editing: Video dialog box, the system checks if a timed transcript for that video exists on edX, and if
  so, automatically associates the transcript with the video. If no transcript is found, you click Upload New Timed Transcript to locate and
  upload the .SRT file for the transcript. 

  When there is an associated timed transcript, you can click Download to Edit to download a local copy of the .SRT file. You can then
  modify the transcript and upload the new file.

  For YouTube videos, you can also import a timed transcript from YouTube, overwriting the version of the transcript on edX with the version
  from YouTube.

  Backwards compatibility with the other transcript workflow is maintained with a tabbed interface.

====================================================
Known Issues and Workarounds
====================================================

* **Uploading a large number of files** (STUD-813, STUD-837)

 When you go to the Files & Uploads page, if your course has a large number of files, the Files & Uploads page can time out before it lists
 all the files. The page becomes unresponsive, and you cannot upload more files.

 **Workaround**: To upload new files files when the Files & Uploads page is timing out, limit the number of files that appear on the Files &
 Uploads page by adding start and max parameters to the URL. For example, you can append the following parameters to the URL in your
 browser:
 https://studio.edge.edx.org/assets/organization.course-number.course-name/branch/block/course-name?start=5&max=15

 This example tells the page to load a maximum of 10 files, starting with the 6th file. You can use other values as needed, as long as the list
 is not so long that the page does not load successfully. Note that file counts begin at 0, not 1, and that files are listed chronologically, with
 the most recent first.
