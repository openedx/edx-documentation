The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of April
30, 2014.  See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

* The HTML component editor is updated to provide a raw HTML editing option. For
  more information, see Working with HTML Components. (STUD-1562)

* You can now upload a handout that is associated with a video directly in the
  Video component editor. Open the **Advanced** tab in the Video component
  editor, and use the **Upload** button to find and add a file from your
  computer:

edX Learning Management System

* Lines in bulk email messages were not wrapped at 998 characters, which caused
  error messages and erroneous characters in some email programs. All lines are
  now wrapped at 998 characters automatically. (LMS-1466)

* Occasionally student submissions for MatLab problems are not graded
  successfully and the MatLab grader times out. There is now a **Reset** button
  that allows students to resubmit their answer without counting the
  resubmission and another attempt of the problem.
