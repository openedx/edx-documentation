The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of August
7, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

***************************************
edX Studio
***************************************

* When you add an Advanced component to a unit in Studio, an identifying name
  for every available component is now included in the list of **Advanced
  Components**. If the component does not have a defined display name, its
  category name appears on this list. Previously, components that did not have
  a display name did not appear as an option in the list.

*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* On the Instructor Dashboard, the **Course Info** page now includes the number
  of students who selected each certification track (Verified, Honor, or Audit)
  in addition to the total number of enrollees in the course.

* For email messages sent from the Instructor Dashboard, two additional
  features are available.

  * On the **Email** page, you can now click **Sent Email History** to see a
    list of sent messages, and click on a message subject to review its
    complete text.

  * When you review a previously sent message, the new **Copy Email to Editor**
    option duplicates the title and body of that message so that you can use it
    as the basis for a new message.

**************************
edX Data & Analytics
**************************

* Daily event tracking data files are now available for download from the
  Amazon S3 storage service. Weekly, cumulative event logs will remain
  available for several weeks.

* A defect that caused session ID values to be duplicated for certain events
  has been fixed. All browser events, and server enrollment events, include a
  value for the session. (AN-2369)

**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce two upcoming features that will release in the next
few weeks:

* In Studio, new capabilities will make it easier for course authors to edit
  and publish content. We've simplified the publishing workflow and added clear
  indications to the UI so you'll know at a glance whether your content is
  published and released--and whether students can see it.

* In addition to the existing Discussion post type, course discussions will
  soon include a new Question post type. Students and course teams will also be
  able to filter posts to find unanswered questions easily.
