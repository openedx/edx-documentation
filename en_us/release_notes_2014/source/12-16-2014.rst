* The size of files that you can upload in the **Files & Uploads** page is now
  limited to 10 MB. If you try to upload a file larger than 10 MB, Studio shows
  a message that the file is too large and could not be uploaded.

* A problem that caused assignment weights in the grading policy to display
  incorrectly is resolved. (TNL-884)

edX Learning Management System
******************************

* Course staff can now assign students to cohorts by uploading a CSV file of
  students and their cohort assignments. See Assign Students to Cohort Groups
  by Uploading a CSV File for more information. (TNL-735)

Coming Soon

Students who enroll in a verified course must currently complete the ID
verification process before completing the payment process. Soon, students will
be able to complete the payment process without completing the verification
process, and vice versa.
