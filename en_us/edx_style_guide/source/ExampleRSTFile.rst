************************************************
Paragraph Text and Commented Text
************************************************

This is an example of regular text in paragraph form. There are no indents. As
a best practice, break lines at about 80 characters, so that each line has its
own line number for commenting in reviews. 

.. warning:: Throughout text and code examples, make sure double quotation
   marks and apostrophes are straight (") or ('), not curly quotatation marks
   and apostrophes, which might be introduced when text is cut and pasted from
   other sources or editors.

Boldface is used for labels that are visible in the user interface. The UI
text is surrounded by double asterisks. For example, **bold**.

Italics are rarely used. Text surrounded by single asterisks is rendered in
*italics*.

Monospace text is used for ``code examples``. Text surrounded by double grave
accent characters is rendered in monospace font. 

``.. comments can be added in a file by starting a line with 2 periods and a space.``

In English source files, look for comments addressed to translators from writers.

``.. Translators:  In this code example, do not translate such and such.``


***************************************
Numbered and Bulleted Lists
***************************************

Use hash symbols for numbered lists.
::

#. Select **Advanced Settings**.
#. Find the **Course Advertised Start Date** policy key.   
#. Enter the value you want to display. 


Use asterisks for bulleted lists.
::

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or college is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

To create a bulleted list inside a numbered list, make sure that you indent
the bulleted list only two spaces instead of three. The bulleted list cannot
be flush with the text in the numbered list, or it will appear as a numbered
list.

::

  To enroll in a course, follow these steps.

  #. On the edX home page, select the course that you want.
  #. When the About page for the course opens, select **Enroll Now** in the
     upper right corner of the page.

    * If your course only offers honor code certificates, you are enrolled in
      the course after you select **Enroll Now**.

    * If your course offers both honor code certificates and verified
      certificates, you must select the type of certificate you want after you
      select **Enroll Now**.



*********************************
Notes and Warnings
*********************************

::

  .. note:: This is note text. If note text runs over a line, make sure the
    lines wrap and are indented to the same level as the note tag. If
    formatting is incorrect, the entire note might not render in the HTML
    output.
    
    Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent
    to the same level as the rest of the note.

****************************
Cross-references
****************************

Cross-references use anchors that are placed above the heading for the target
section. Anchors are defined in lines beginning with 2 periods, followed by a
space, underscore and the anchor text, and ending with a colon.

For example, ``.. _Anchors and Internal Links:``

You can also see examples of anchors above the first three headings in this document.

Anchor text is never visible in output. It is always replaced either by the
text of the anchored topic heading, or by the specified link text.

=================================================
Example of cross-reference using anchor only
=================================================

For cross-references that use the actual text of the target topicâ€™s heading,
use ``:ref:`Anchor_text``` syntax. For example,
::

   Ensure that your course introduction video follows the same
   :ref:`Compression Specifications` and :ref:`Video Formats` guidelines as
   course content videos

where "Compression Specifications" and "Video Formats" are the text for
anchors that exist somewhere in the files that make up the guide. In output,
the actual text of the associated headings is substituted.

=======================================================
Example of cross-reference using specified link text
=======================================================

::

  For more information, see :ref:`the introductory section on
  exercises<Exercises_introduction>`

where ``Exercises_introduction`` is the anchor text that exists somewhere in
the files that make up the guide, and "the introduction section on exercises"
is your preferred link text.

Image links can include optional specifications such as height, width, or

text that is useful to someone who might not be able to see the image.

Tables

Each example in this section shows the raw formatting for the table followed by the table as it would render (if you are viewing this file as part of the Style Guide).

   * - Annotation Problem
     - 
     - Annotation problems ask students to respond to questions about a
       specific block of text. The question appears above the text when the
       student hovers the mouse over the highlighted text so that students can
       think about the question as they read.   
   * - Example Poll
     - Conditional Module
     - You can create a conditional module to control versions of content that
        groups of students see. For example, students who answer "Yes" to a
        poll question then see a different block of text from the students who
        answer "No" to that question.
   * - Example JavaScript Problem
     - Custom JavaScript
     - Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called *custom
       JavaScript problems* or *JS Input problems*) allow you to create a
       custom problem or tool that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or
       tool directly into Studio.

The blank lines before and after the bulleted list are critical for the list

*****************
Code Formatting
*****************

===========
Inline code
===========

In inline text, any text can be formatted as code (monospace font) by
enclosing the selection within a pair of double "grave accent" characters (`).
For example, ````these words```` are formatted in a monospace font when the
documentation is output as PDF or HTML.

===========
Code blocks
===========


To set text in a code block, end the previous paragaph with 2 colons, leave
one line before the intended code block, and make sure the code block is
indented beyond the first colon. 
::

 For example, this is the introductory paragraph
 ::

  <p>and this is the code block following.</p>


Alternatively, use the code-block tag. Optionally, indicate the type of code
after the 2 colons in the tag, which results in the tags within the code block
being displayed in different colors.
::
  
 .. code-block:: xml
