Paragraph Text and Commented Text
************************************************

This is an example of regular text in paragraph form. There are no indents. As
a best practice, break lines at about 80 characters, so that each line has its
own line number for commenting in reviews.

.. warning:: Throughout text and code examples, make sure double quotation
   marks and apostrophes are straight (") or ('), not curly quotatation marks
   and apostrophes, which might be introduced when text is cut and pasted from
   other sources or editors.

Boldface is used for labels that are visible in the user interface. The UI
text is surrounded by double asterisks. For example, **bold**.

Italics are rarely used. Text surrounded by single asterisks is rendered in
*italics*.

Monospace text is used for ``code examples``. Text surrounded by double grave
accent characters is rendered in monospace font.

``.. comments can be added in a file by starting a line with 2 periods and a space.``

In English source files, look for comments addressed to translators from writers.

``.. Translators:  In this code example, do not translate such and such.``


***************************************
Ordered and Unordered Lists
***************************************

Use hash symbols for ordered lists.

::

#. Select **Advanced Settings**.
#. Find the **Course Advertised Start Date** policy key.
#. Enter the value you want to display.

.. note::
 Ordered lists usually use numerals. Nested ordered lists (ordered lists inside
 other ordered lists) use letters.

Use asterisks for unordered (bulleted) lists.

::

* Who is teaching the course?
* What university or college is the course affiliated with?
* What topics and concepts are covered in your course?
* Why should a learner enroll in your course?

=======================
Nested Lists or Content
=======================

You can include content including additional lists and code examples inside
lists.

Unordered List inside Ordered List
***************************************

To include an unordered list inside an ordered list, indent the unordered list
three spaces. The first bullet in the unordered list must be flush with the
text in the ordered list.

::

  #. Review your entry to verify that the key is accurate and that it is
     surrounded by quotation marks. If there is a list of keys, they must be
     comma separated.

     * In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is the only
       value in the list.

     * In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is added at
       the beginning of a list of other keys.

  #. Select **Save Changes**.

Ordered List inside Unordered List
***************************************

To include an ordered list inside an unordered list, indent the ordered list
two spaces. The first number or letter of the ordered list must be flush with
the text in the unordered list.

::

  * Review your entry to verify that the key is accurate and that it is
    surrounded by quotation marks. If there is a list of keys, they must be comma
    separated.

    #. In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is the only
       value in the list.

    #. In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is added at the
       beginning of a list of other keys.

  * Select **Save Changes**.

.. There isn't a screen shot of the above example yet because these lists don't
.. render correctly locally, and searching for an example in the built docs
.. online was taking too much time.

Unordered List inside Unordered List
***************************************

To include an unordered list inside another unordered list, indent the second
unordered list two spaces. The first bullet of the second unordered list must
be flush with the text in the unordered list.

::

  * Review your entry to verify that the key is accurate and that it is
    surrounded by quotation marks. If there is a list of keys, they must be
    comma separated.

    #. In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is the only
       value in the list.

Ordered List inside Ordered List
***************************************

To include another ordered list inside an ordered list, indent the second
ordered list three spaces. The second ordered list must be flush with the text
in the numbered list. The first ordered list uses numerals, and the second
uses letters.

::

  #. Review your entry to verify that the key is accurate and that it is
     surrounded by quotation marks. If there is a list of keys, they must be
     comma separated.

     #. In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is the only
        value in the list.

     #. In this example, the key for the Annotation Problem tool is added at
        the beginning of a list of other keys.

  #. Select **Save Changes**.

.. There isn't a screen shot of the above example yet because these lists don't
.. render correctly locally, and searching for an example in the built docs
.. online was taking too much time.

Code, Images, and Other Content inside Lists
*********************************************

To include content such as code or an image inside a list, position the code or
image directive flush with the text in the list. That is, indent three spaces
for ordered lists and two spaces for unordered lists.

::

  #. In the ``lms.env.json`` and ``cms.env.json`` files, set the value of
     ``CERTIFICATES_HTML_VIEW`` within the ``FEATURES`` object  to ``true``.

     .. code-block:: bash

       "FEATURES": {
           ...
           'CERTIFICATES_HTML_VIEW': true,
           ...
       }

  #. Save the ``lms.env.json`` and ``cms.env.json`` files.


***************************************
Conditional Text
***************************************

To conditionalize a single paragraph, use either the ``only:: Partners`` or
the ``only:: Open_edX`` directive, and indent the paragraph under the
directive. You can add the conditional text as regular text or as a note.

Make sure to indent the paragraph under the directive.

::

  .. only:: Partners

   Data about course enrollment is available from edX Insights. You can access
   Insights from the instructor dashboard for your live course: after you select
   **Instructor**, follow the link in the banner at the top of each page. For
   more information, see `Using edX Insights`_.

  .. only:: Open_edX

      .. note::
        If you want to require an entrance exam for your course, you also create
        the exam in the course outline. Before you can create an exam, you must
        set your course to require an entrance exam in Studio. For more
        information, see :ref:`Require an Entrance Exam`.

To conditionalize more than a paragraph, use either the ``only:: Partners`` or
the ``only:: Open_edX`` directive, and then use an ``include::`` directive
indented under the only directive.

::

  .. only:: Open_edX

     .. include:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/running_course/Section_course_student.rst



*********************************
Notes and Warnings
*********************************

::

 .. note::
    This is note text. If note text runs over a line, make sure the lines wrap
    and are indented to the same level as the note tag. If formatting is
    incorrect, part of the note might not render in the HTML output.

    Notes can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must indent
    to the same level as the rest of the note.

****************************
Cross-References
****************************

In edX documents, you can include cross-references to other locations in the
same edX document, to locations in other edX documents (such as a cross-
reference from a location in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide to
a location in the *EdX Learner's Guide*), to JIRA stories, and to external
websites. In this section, "EdX documents" refers to the resources, including
guides and tutorials, that are listed on docs.edx.org.

For more information about creating cross-references using RST and Sphinx, see
`Cross-referencing arbitrary locations`_ in the online Sphinx documentation.

==================================================
Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document
==================================================

Cross-references to locations in the same document use anchors that are located
above the heading for each topic or section. Anchors can contain numbers,
letters, spaces, underscores, and hyphens, but cannot include punctuation.
Anchors use the following syntax.

::

  .. _Anchor Text:

The following example shows an anchor for a section, followed by the heading
for that section. ``SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts`` is the anchor text.

::

  .. _SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts:

  ******************************
  Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes
  ******************************

To create cross-references to locations in the same document, you can use the
anchor only, or you can use your own text. The anchor text is never visible in
output. It is replaced by the text of the heading that follows the anchor or
the text that you specify.

Cross-References Using the Anchor Only
********************************************

To add a cross-reference to a specific location in a document and use the text
of the heading for that location as link text, use ``:ref:`Anchor Text```
syntax, as in the following example.

::

   For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see :ref:`SFD SN
   Keyboard Shortcuts`.

In this example, "SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts" is the anchor text for a section
that is titled "Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes". Readers will see the following
text, and "Keyboard Shortcuts for Notes" will be an active link.

::

  For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see Keyboard Shortcuts
  for Notes.

Cross-References Using Specified Link Text
*******************************************

For internal cross-references that use text other than the heading for the
section that you're linking to, use ``:ref:`specified text<Anchor Text>```
syntax, as in the following example.

::

  If you want to, you can use :ref:`keyboard shortcuts<SFD SN Keyboard
  Shortcuts>` to create, edit, and view notes.

.. note::
  Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the opening
  angle bracket for the anchor text.

In this example, "keyboard shortcuts" is the link text, and "SFD SN Keyboard
Shortcuts" is the anchor text for a section that is titled "Keyboard Shortcuts
for Notes". Readers will see the following text, and "keyboard shortcuts" will
be an active link.

::

  If you want to, you can use keyboard shortcuts to create, edit, and view your
  notes.

==========================================================
Cross-References to Locations in Different edX Documents
==========================================================

You can create cross-references between different edX documents. For example,
you can create a link in *Building and Running an edX Course* to a topic in the
*EdX Learner's Guide*. To do this, you use the intersphinx map ID of the
document that you want to link to and the anchor text for the section you want.
The cross-reference uses the following syntax.

::

  :ref:`intersphinx_map_ID:Anchor Name`

For example:

::

  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Release Dates`

To find the intersphinx map ID for the document that you want, follow these
steps.

#. Open the conf.py file in the `edx-documentation/shared`_ folder, and then
   locate the following line.

   ``intersphinx_mapping = {``

#. In the list that follows this line, find the ID for the document that you
   want. The text between the single quotation marks (') at the beginning of
   each line is the intersphinx map ID for the document.

The following intersphinx map IDs are the most frequently used.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 25 50

  * - Map ID
    - Document
  * - ``partnercoursestaff``
    - *Building and Running an edX Course*
  * - ``opencoursestaff``
    - *Building and Running an Open edX Course*
  * - ``learners``
    - *EdX Learner's Guide*
  * - ``openlearners``
    - *Open edX Learner's Guide*
  * - ``data``
    - *EdX Research Guide*
  * - ``insights``
    - *Using edX Insights*
  * - ``installation``
    - *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform*
  * - ``opendevelopers``
    - *Open edX Developer's Guide*
  * - ``partnerreleasenotes``
    - Partner release notes
  * - ``openreleasenotes``
    - Open edX release notes

============================================
Cross-References to JIRA
============================================

For cross-references to JIRA tickets, use the ``:jira:`PROJECT-ticketnumber```
syntax, as in the following example.

::

  For more information, see :jira:`DOC-2316`.

Note that ``jira`` replaces ``ref`` for these links.

Readers will see the following text, and "DOC-2316" will be an active link.

``For more information, see DOC-2316.``

============================================
Cross-References to External Web Pages
============================================

A cross-reference to an external web page has several elements.

* The URL of the external web page.
* The text to use for the cross-reference. This text becomes an anchor in the
  file that contains the cross-reference.
* An ``include`` directive in the file that contains the cross-reference to the
  links.rst file that is located in the ``edx-documentation/en_us/links/``
  folder.
* An entry in the links.rst file.

To create an external cross-reference, follow these steps.

#. In the paragraph where you want the cross-reference, add the text that you
   want to use for the link, formatted as follows (where "Release Pages" is the
   link text). This creates an anchor out of that text.

   ::

      The edX engineering wiki `Release Pages`_ provide access to detailed
      information about every change made to the edx-platform GitHub
      repository.

#. In the file that contains the cross-reference, add an ``include`` directive
   for the ``edx-documentation/en_us/links/links.rst`` file if one does not
   already exist. These ``include`` directives are typically at the end of the
   file.

   ::

      .. include:: ../../links/links.rst

   .. note::

      The path to the links.rst file depends on the location of the file where
      you are creating the link. For example, the path might be
      ``../../../links/links.rst`` or ``../links/links.rst``.

#. In the ``edx-documentation/en_us/links/links.rst`` file, add an entry for
   the anchor text and the URL of the external website, formatted as follows.
   Make sure that the anchor text in this file matches the anchor text in the
   file that contains the cross-reference exactly, including capitalization.

    ::

      .. _Release Pages: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/Release+Pages

Readers will see the following text. "Release Pages" will be an active link.

::

      The edX engineering wiki Release Pages provide access to detailed
      information about every change made to the edx-platform GitHub
      repository.


****************************
Image References
****************************

Image references look like this.

     :width: 100
     :alt: A screen capture showing the elements of the course outline in the LMS.


Image links can include optional specifications such as height, width, or

Tables
************************************

Each example in this section shows the raw formatting for the table followed
by the table as it would render (if you are viewing this file as part of the
Style Guide).

======================================

The empty cell is the second column in the first row of this table.
::

  .. list-table::

   * - Annotation Problem
     -
     - Annotation problems ask students to respond to questions about a
       specific block of text. The question appears above the text when the
       student hovers the mouse over the highlighted text so that students can
       think about the question as they read.
   * - Example Poll
     - Conditional Module
     - You can create a conditional module to control versions of content that
        groups of students see. For example, students who answer "Yes" to a
        poll question then see a different block of text from the students who
        answer "No" to that question.
   * - Example JavaScript Problem
     - Custom JavaScript
     - Custom JavaScript display and grading problems (also called *custom
       JavaScript problems* or *JS input problems*) allow you to create a
       custom problem or tool that uses JavaScript and then add the problem or
       tool directly into Studio.

*****************
Code Formatting
*****************

===========
Inline code
===========

In inline text, any text can be formatted as code (monospace font) by
enclosing the selection within a pair of double "grave accent" characters (`).
For example, ````these words```` are formatted in a monospace font when the
documentation is output as PDF or HTML.

===========
Code blocks
===========


To set text in a code block, end the previous paragaph with 2 colons, leave
one line before the intended code block, and make sure the code block is
indented beyond the first colon.
::

 For example, this is the introductory paragraph
 ::

  <p>and this is the code block following.</p>


Alternatively, use the code-block tag. Optionally, indicate the type of code
after the 2 colons in the tag, which results in the tags within the code block
being displayed in different colors.
::

 .. code-block:: xml
