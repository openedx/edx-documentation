Writing Concept Topics
########################

Concept topics answer "Why?" and What is...?" questions. Concept topics build
on existing audience knowledge to provide general explanations, background
information, and examples to help the reader understand a feature or task.

Concept topics explain abstract ideas and introduce terminology. Concept
topics tend to be relatively unaffected by feature enhancements over time:
while additions might be needed to support new options and their use cases,
they tend to require less rewriting than task topics.

Concept topics are typically followed by at least one task topic. When they
introduce complex features, they are followed by a set of additional concept
topics and related task topics.
