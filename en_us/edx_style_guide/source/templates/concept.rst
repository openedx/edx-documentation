Writing Concept Topics
########################

Concept topics answer "Why?" and What is...?" questions. Concept topics build
on existing audience knowledge to provide general explanations, background
information, and examples to help the reader understand a feature or task.

Concept topics explain abstract ideas and introduce terminology. Concept
topics tend to be relatively unaffected by feature enhancements over time:
while additions might be needed to support new options and their use cases,
they tend to require less rewriting than task topics.

Concept topics are typically followed by at least one task topic. When they
introduce complex features, they can be followed by a set of additional concept
topics and related task topics.

******************************

Example Concept Topics
******************************

The *Building and Running an edX Course* guide contains these examples of
concept topics.

* :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Cohorts Overview` introduces a complex
  topic. It includes several subsections to divide the concept into different
  facets. A list of related tasks is included at the beginning to redirect
  readers who might not need this background information.

* :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Develop a Positive Discussion Culture` uses examples
  to define the concept of a positive discussion culture, and then offers a
  concrete example of actions to take for each one. This topic also provides a
  link to a related template.

* :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Course_Wiki` introduces a section of related
  concepts and tasks. It defines a wiki in the context of an edX course, and
  provides example uses.

* :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Add a Video Transcript` introduces a series of
  tasks.
