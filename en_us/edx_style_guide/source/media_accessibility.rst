Media Accessibility
######################

The edX documentation team is committed to providing resources that are
accessible to everyone. The following information was originally written by
Mark Sadecki, the edX accessibility specialist, for course teams who need to
prepare accessible media. Its content is also useful for writers who are
preparing instructional videos and technical documentation.

*************
Introduction
*************

Sometimes it can be helpful to start any discussion on media accessibility by
dispelling common myths and talking about the challenges people with
disabilities face when consuming media before talking about the solutions. Mark
put together the following information about how people with disabilities
consume media, what their challenges are, and how authors can provide
solutions.

*************
Blindness
*************

People who are blind cannot access the visual information contained in videos.
Some would conclude that the visual medium is inherently inaccessible to those
who cannot see. However, audio and digital text are still very accessible. In
accessibility we often talk about "alternative content." With regard to media,
audio and text can easily serve as alternative content for the blind. Good
alternative content is equivalent content. Content is equivalent to other
content when both fulfill the same function or purpose when presented to the
user.

============================
Things to Keep in Mind
============================

Here are a few things to keep in mind when creating media for your courses.

* Vocalize any print that appears in your video.

* Explain visual events that are important to the context of the video. This
  will improve the quality of your material, ensuring that all students
  understand the significance of what they are observing.

* Avoid using phrases like "over here we have..." or "this number..." that rely
  on a visual cue to comprehend.

====================================================
How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
====================================================

Learners are increasingly consuming media while performing other tasks, such as
driving, doing household chores, and so on, and they may not be able to focus
on the video content at all. Try listening to only the audio track from your
video. Is the information presented "equivalent"?

.. note:: With regard to blindness, Mark feels that it is important to drive 
 home the fact that if you do not vocalize unspoken visual events that are
 important to understanding the video, you will trigger a requirement to
 provide :ref:`audio descriptions<Audio Description>`, which is both expensive
 and time consuming.

*************
Low Vision
*************

People with low vision can access some visual information. Depending on their
visual ability, they might have specific issues such as difficulty discerning
foreground information from background information, or discerning between
colors. They may be unable to react quickly to transient information, and may
have a narrow angle of view and so may not detect key information presented
temporarily where they are not looking, or in text that is moving or scrolling.

A person with low vision is likely to use screen magnification software. This
means that they will only be viewing a portion of the screen, and so must
manage tracking media content. 

Others with low vision may have difficulty reading when text is too small, has
poor background contrast, or when decorative fonts or effects are used. Users
with low vision often benefit from the same vocalization techniques used to
provide access to those who are blind.

============================
Things to Keep in Mind
============================

* Make sure important visual content remains on the screen long enough to be
  processed.

* Consider contrast and lighting when choosing settings and adding visual
  content.

* Use as much of the viewport as possible to present information.

* Be consistent with the placement of important visual information.

====================================================
How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
====================================================

Multimedia is increasingly being consumed on mobile devices that have a very
small viewport. Many of the techniques mentioned above will benefit users who
consume your content on a mobile device.

*************
Deafness
*************

People who are deaf generally cannot access the audio content of your media. As
a result, an alternative format is required. On edX, this is provided through
synchronized captions. 

============================
Things to Keep in Mind
============================

When creating timed-text caption files, be sure to include descriptions of
audible, non-speech content that is important to comprehending the video (such
as [APPLAUSE], [BUZZER], [ASCENDING TONE]).

The text should "fulfill the same function or purpose" as the audio.

====================================================
How These Techniques Can Benefit a Broader Audience
====================================================

Captions are useful for those who do not speak the same language as the speaker
in the video. Onscreen text is easier to comprehend than spoken words. Captions
can also be translated into other languages very easily.

**************************
Hard of Hearing
**************************

People who are hard of hearing may be able to access some audio material, but
might not be able to discern certain types of sound, and may miss any
information presented as audio only if it contains frequencies they can't hear,
or is masked by background noise or distortion. They may miss audio which is
too quiet, or of poor quality. People with cochlear implants may not have
issues with audio volume levels, but comprehension may be challenging if the
media experience is overwhelming. People who are deaf or hard of hearing may
also read lips.

============================
Things to Keep in Mind
============================

* Speak loudly and clearly.

* Try to face the camera as much as possible when speaking onscreen.

* Avoid background noise and/or music that competes with the primary audio.

WCAG 2 AA Requirements for Media
*********************************

EdX is committed to satisfying the requirements defined in WCAG 2.0 Level AA.
Excerpted below are the `WCAG 2.0 guidelines`_ that refer specifically to
media. The goal of any training done at edX should be to ensure that course
teams create content that satisfies these criteria.

=========================
Principle 1: Perceivable
=========================

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways
they can perceive.

Guideline 1.1 Text Alternatives
*************************************

Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed
into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or
simpler language.

1.1.1 Non-text Content
=======================

All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that
serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. (Level
A)

* Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text
  alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text
  content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)

* Guideline 1.2 Time-based Media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.

1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)
==============================================

For prerecorded audio-only and prerecorded video-only media, the following are
true, except when the audio or video is a media alternative for text and is
clearly labeled as such: (Level A)

* Prerecorded Audio-only: An alternative for time-based media is provided that
  presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.

* Prerecorded Video-only: Either an alternative for time-based media or an
  audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded
  video-only content.

1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)
====================================

Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media,
except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as
such. (Level A)

1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)
=====================================================================

An alternative for time-based media or audio description of the prerecorded
video content is provided for synchronized media, except when the media is a
media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such. (Level A)

1.2.4 Captions (Live)
=======================

Captions are provided for all live audio content in synchronized media. (Level
AA)

1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)
==============================================

Audio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized
media. (Level AA)

Audio Description

Most people are not familiar with `audio descriptions`_. This video was made
expressly to demonstrate both the need for, and the level of detail required
for, quality audio description. It also happens to be a good example of quality
captioning as well.
