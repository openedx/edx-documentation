  * - can, might, and may
    - Use the verb "can" to describe ability, capability, or capacity. Use
      "might" to describe possibility or eventuality. Because "may" implies
      permission, the edX documentation team prefers to use one of the other
      two verbs.
  * - capitalization
    - Use title capitalization for headings. When referring to elements in the
      user interface, follow the capitalization that is used in the labels or
      text.

      Do not capitalize job titles, such as professor, instructor, or program
      manager. Do not capitalize terms unless they are trademarks, so refer to
      the instructor dashboard or a course about video rather than the
      Instructor Dashboard or a course About video.

  * - contractions
    - Do not use.
  * - cross-references
    - Introduce standalone cross-references to other edX topics with the
      phrase, "For more information, see ``:ref:`{topic name}```". To include
      more specific information about the material you are referencing, use the
      expanded phrase, "For more information about {task or concept}, see
      ``:ref:`{topic name}```".

      Exception: In the glossary, cross-references to other glossary entries
      begin with, "See ``:ref:`{topic name}```" if the current entry consists
      only of the cross reference. To refer to a related entry, use "See also
      ``:ref:`{topic name}```".

      To include a cross-reference inline, extend the cross-reference to
      include a phrase that makes sense in context. In this example, to create
      a sentence with the correct capitalization, "course launch checklist" is
      added to the cross-reference markup. "To verify that the course is ready
      for release, you can use the ``:ref:`course launch checklist<Course
      Launch Checklist>```."

      For a cross-reference to an external resource, provide the title of the
      destination, not just a URL. This style promotes a better experience
      for those using screen readers. In addition, avoid repeating links to the
      same destination multiple times on a single HTML page.

      Exception: use "edx.org" to refer to the https://www.edx.org website.

  * - dates
    - Format dates as ``DD Mon YYYY`` or ``DD Month YYYY``. For example, ``11
      Jan 2015``. Do not use both date formats within the same .rst file.
  * - first person
    - Do not use "I" or "me" unless you are following the text of a user
      interface label or message. Avoid using "we". If edX or another entity
      has established a best practice, identify the the entity that recommends
      that practice by name.
  * - heading style
    - Use title case for all headings. For a top level section heading and for
      topics that introduce concepts, use a verb in gerund form to start the
      title. For topics that describe a procedure, use an imperative verb to
      start the title.

      For example, "Adding Course Updates and Handouts", "Adding a Course
      Update", and "Identify a Course Handout".

      Avoid the use of nouns or noun phrases without a verb as headings.

  * - hyphenation
    - Minimize the use of hyphenated compounds. Present compound words as
      either two separate words or a single word. Use hyphens only when the
      meaning is unclear without them. For exceptions to this rule, see the
      :ref:`word list<Word List>`.
  * - images
    - Minimize the use of screen shots. For more information, see
      :ref:`Images`.
  * - lists
    - Introduce a list with a complete sentence that ends in a period. Do not
      use "the following" as a noun or to introduce a list. Instead, include
      the noun. For example, "The .csv file includes the following columns." or
      "When pretty printed, this comment has the following format.""
  * - pronouns
    - Avoid ambiguous pronouns such as all, each, many, several, some, that,
      them, these, those.
  * - punctuation
    - Avoid slashes, particularly "and/or". They introduce ambiguity.

      Avoid em dashes. Putting non-restrictive relative clauses into separate
      sentences leads to simpler, clearer writing.

      Do not use smart quotes or smart apostrophes. Use the straight versions
      of these marks.

  * - redundancy
    - Avoid including unnecessary words. For example, instead of "Create a new
      {noun}", use "Create a {noun}", and instead of "Delete or edit an
      existing {noun}", use "Delete or edit a {noun}."
  * - steps
    - To introduce an ordered list of procedural steps, use "To {verb task},
      follow these steps." Note the complete sentence and terminal period. For
      example, "To add a course update, follow these steps.""
  * - tables
    - When you include a table, be sure to include a heading row. In addition,
      consider whether a stub column is appropriate. The heading row and stub
      column provide useful context for users of screen readers.
  * - word choice
    - See the :ref:`Word List` for our preferred terminology. Avoid jargon,
      colloquialisms, and humor.

      Do not use non-technical words that are not in common use, such as "and
      so forth", albeit, heretofore, thus, or whilst.

      Be careful of commonly used phrases that introduce ambiguity. For
      example, instead of "When the process completes..." use "After the
      process completes..."
