Documenting the User Interface
###############################

In describing UI interactions, we refer to labels alone, rather than include
specific descriptions of the UI controls.

* Incorrect: In the **Randomization** drop-down list, click the **Never** option.

* Correct: From the **Randomization** list, select **Never**.

This is primarily to reduce word count, and also because the UI can change
without notice. Another reason is related to the use of screen readers:
controls can be styled to appear as other controls, such as a link that is
styled to look like a button. The screen reader organizes all link selections
together, and all button selections together, so if the documentation refers
to a link as a button, we can actually make it harder for people to find the
choice that they want.

****************************
Standards for UI Labels
****************************

When the doc team contributes to the wording and formatting of UI labels, we
follow these standards.

All UI elements should use sentence capitalization except the following items,
which use title capitalization.

* Page titles
* Tab titles
* Buttons (these usually have only a few words)
