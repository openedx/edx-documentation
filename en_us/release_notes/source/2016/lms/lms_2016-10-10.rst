Course Navigation Updates
=========================

To improve the experience of learners and course teams as they navigate through
a course, this release includes several updates to the user interface controls
that appear on the **Course** page.

This release includes updates to the following options on this page.

#. **Previous**: Go to the previous course unit.

#. **Next**: Go to the next course unit.

#. **Components**: Icons to identify course components that contain text,
   video, or problems.

#. **Bookmark**: Bookmark the current page for future reference.

The following images illustrate the differences.

     controls as of 12 October 2016, overlaid on the page with the older user
     interface controls, with numbered callouts for each of the options
     described above.

In addition, when you select the newly renamed **Bookmark this page** option,
its label now changes to **Bookmarked**.

     with the older user interface controls.

Note also that the course component that you are currently viewing is indicated
by a blue underlining bar in the unit navigation bar, rather than by a lighter
shade of gray.

Changes (Open edX)`_" on the Open edX portal.

========================================
Updated Options for Answering Problems
========================================

To improve the experience of learners when they answer problems, this release
includes several changes to the user interface controls for core problem types.
A summary of the changes follows.

* The **Check** and **Final Check** options have been consolidated and
  relabeled **Submit**.

* Options for secondary actions, including **Save**, **Hint**, **Reset**, and
  **Show Answer**, are separated from **Submit** through both different visual
  presentation and spatial separation.

* A message that identifies the problem as graded or ungraded appears under the
  problem's display name.

* A banner now shows the correct or incorrect feedback message in addition to
  the green check mark or red X next to the answer. For learners who access the
  course with a screen reader or a keyboard only, this banner includes
  additional options for navigation within the problem.

The following image illustrates the changes in the appearance of a graded
problem before you attempt an answer.

        one side and Save and Show Answer icons on the other side.

The following image shows the same problem after you submit the correct answer
and select **Show Answer**.

        awarded.

Types (partners)`_" on the edX partner portal, or "Coming Soon: `Enhancements
for Standard Problem Types (Open edX)`_" on the Open edX portal.

Other Changes
=============

* In courses with proctored exams, learners who have not yet verified their
  identities, or whose identity verifications have expired, must now complete
  ID verification before they can open a proctored exam. (:jira:`TNL-5083`)

* For discussion posts, the preview window that shows rendered mathematical
  notation now displays each rendered line in the same order that the MathJax
  formatting was entered in the body of the post. (:jira:`TNL-5451`)
