  calculation for the Progress page. Changes include ending support for the
  XBlock field ``always_recalculate_grades``, which was not used in any active
  XBlocks, and caused performance issues when set to True. (:jira:`TNL-4453`)

* Staff can now use the "View As Specific Student" feature to see timed exam
  content as a particular learner, even if the timed exam is hidden from
  learners after they submit the exam. (:jira:`TNL-4808`)

  menu options and the calculator. (:jira:`AC-454`, :jira:`AC-484`,
