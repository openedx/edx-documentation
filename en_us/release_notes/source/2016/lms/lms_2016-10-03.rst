* The contrast used on the sign in page for Open edX sites has changed. When
  visitors move their cursors onto a course tile on this page, the contrast
  used for the **Learn More** link that appears now meets accessibility
  standards. :jira:`AC-586`

* In the survey tool, available response options are now correctly associated
  with their respective text labels and with the survey question. Additionally,
  when a response is accepted from a learner who uses a screen reader, focus
  moves to the beginning of the survey so the learner can review the survey
  results. For more information about the survey tool, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Survey Tool` in *Building and Running an edX Course*
  or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Survey Tool` in *Building and Running an Open edX
  Course*. :jira:`SOL-2059`

*  When learners select **Help** in an edx.org course, the :ref:`learners:edX
   Learner's Guide` now opens to a related topic.
