* Cohorts have been added to bulk email **Send to** options. In addition to
  existing groups, course teams can now send bulk email messages to one or more
  of the cohorts in their courses. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:bulk_email_message_addressing` or
  :ref:`opencoursestaff:bulk_email_message_addressing`. (:jira:`TNL-4357`)

* The learner **Account Settings** page now includes an **Order History** tab.
  This tab contains information about any payments a learner has made to edX,
  including the date of the payment and a link to a receipt page. For more
  information, see :ref:`learners:View Order History`. (:jira:`ECOM-2361`)

* The explanation of additional time allowances for timed and proctored
  examinations has been reworded. The words "or are taking the exam in
  difficult conditions" have been removed to make it clearer that additional
  time allowances are intended for learners who have disabilities. The new
  wording of the explanation is "if you have disabilities, you might be
  eligible for an additional time allowance on timed exams." (:jira:`TNL-4654`)

* If the amount of time allowed for a timed exam is longer than 20 hours, the
  LMS does not display a message explaining that learners can request
  additional time. If needed, course teams can still allow additional time for
  learners taking timed exams that are longer than 20 hours. (:jira:`TNL-4655`)
