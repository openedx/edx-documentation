* When learners submit or save another response after seeing feedback for a
  previous response, the feedback now correctly refreshes to indicate whether
  the new response is correct or incorrect. Previously, the problem continued to
  show feedback for the previous response. (:JIRA:`TNL-1955`)

* Course start and end dates in the "Basic Course Information" section of the
  **Course Info** tab on the instructor dashboard and in the sidebar on course
  **Home** pages are now displayed in your account's time zone or, if you have
  not specified a local time zone, in your browser's time zone.
  (:JIRA:`TNL-5960`)

* In course discussions, each post in the discussion navigation pane now
  includes a one line preview. (:JIRA:`TNL-5807`) For more information about
  course discussions, see :ref:`learners:Anatomy of edX Course Discussions` in
  the *EdX Learner's Guide* and :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Discussions` in the
  *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

* Open response assessment (ORA) exercises have been improved with
  accessibility fixes, including color contrast and screen reader
  enhancements. (:JIRA:`TNL-5104`, :JIRA:`TNL-5786`)
