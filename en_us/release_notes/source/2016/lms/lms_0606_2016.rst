Options for sending bulk email messages have changed. When course teams send
bulk email messages from the LMS, they can now select one or more of these
recipient groups: **Myself**, **Staff and Administrators**, and **All
Learners**. When you send an email message to more than one of these groups,
duplicate recipients are filtered out, so that recipients who are in more than
one group do not receive multiple copies of the same email message.
