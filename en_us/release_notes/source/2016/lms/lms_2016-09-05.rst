Drag and Drop Problems
======================

The following changes have been made to drag and drop problems.

* Drag and drop problems now align all items in a target zone after learners
  drop them. Previously, aligning dropped items was optional.

* The behavior of drag and drop problems in the recently-added assessment mode
  has changed. Now drag and drop problems display feedback messages after a
  learner selects **Submit** to grade a problem. Previously, drag and drop
  problems suppressed feedback messages in assessment mode.

* Usability and accessibility improvements have been made to the drag and drop
  problem editor in Studio. (:jira:`SOL-1979` and :jira:`SOL-1980`)

Other Changes
=============

* Colors for several buttons in the LMS, including in the course discussions,
  have been updated to increase contrast for accessibility. (:jira:`AC-570`,
  :jira:`TNL-5163`)
