* This release adds a new option for rescoring specific course problems to the
  **Student Admin** page on the Instructor Dashboard and to the **Staff Debug
  Info** option for each problem. Course teams can use the **Rescore Only if
  Score Improves** option (for an individual learner) or the **Rescore Only if
  Scores Improve** option (for all learners) when they want to rescore a
  problem in a course, but scores are only updated if the scores improve. If
  rescoring the problem causes a learner's score to decrease, the edX grader
  does not rescore the problem for that learner. (:jira:`TNL-5046`)

* This release also updates, streamlines, and clarifies text and options on the
  **Student Admin** page on the Instructor Dashboard.
