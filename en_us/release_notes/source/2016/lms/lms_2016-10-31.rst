* This release updates the course **Progress** page to improve the
  accessibility of the page for learners who use screen readers. This page now
  has a logical and meaningful HTML structure, and heading levels and
  indentation are now consistently applied. (:jira:`AC-582`)

* Course team members who use the bulk email feature can now
  :ref:`review details <partnercoursestaff:Review Sent Messages>` for the
  messages they send by selecting **Instructor**, **Email**, **Email Task
  History**, and then **Show Sent Email History**. Previously, the message
  did not open as expected in a dialog box. (:jira:`TNL-5840`)

* When you view your course as a student,
  :ref:`custom pages <partnercoursestaff:Add Page>` that you defined to be
  hidden from students no longer appear in the LMS. (:jira:`OSPR-1528`)
