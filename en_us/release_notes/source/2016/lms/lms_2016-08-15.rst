* In account settings, after learners specify their country or region and then
  select the time zone field, the time zones are now sorted to show time zones
  applicable to the selected country at the top of the list. (:jira:`TNL-4791`)

* The learner dashboard now displays programs of any type. Course runs listed
  on the dashboard link to related programs, and program cards are no longer
  limited to XSeries only. (:jira:`ECOM-4638`)

* For some courses, course teams reported that selecting a discussion post
  failed to show its responses and comments as expected. The defect that caused
  this problem in the course discussions has been corrected. (:jira:`TNL-5173`)

* An error in the way that some numerical input problems appeared to learners
  has been corrected. Trailing text is now responsive, meaning that it appears
  next to the response field if there is sufficient space. Trailing text
  appears below the response field only if the browser window or mobile device
  screen is too narrow to show them side by side. (:jira:`TNL-4584`)

* Learners were unable to use the Safari browser to verify their
  identification. This error has been corrected. (:jira:`ECOM-5149`)
