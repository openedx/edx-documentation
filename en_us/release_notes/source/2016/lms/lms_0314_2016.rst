====================================
New Report of Learner ORA Responses
====================================

A new report for ORA assignments is now available on the Instructor Dashboard.
For each ORA assignment in the course, the report includes each learner's
response, assessment details and scores, the final score for the assignment,
and any feedback provided by the learner about the peer assessment process.
Learners are identified by anonymized ID in this report.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Generate ORA Report` in the
*Building and Running an edX Course* guide, or, for Open edX installations,
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Generate ORA Report` in the *Building and Running an Open
edX Course* guide.

Other Changes
================

* This release corrects errors that occurred after a course team member deleted
  student state for an ORA assignment submission. After student state was
  deleted, information about the submission continued to appear in the **Staff
  Debug** dialog box. In addition, when the learner attempted to submit a new
  response, the attempt failed. These errors now longer occur. (TNL-3880)

* This release includes several updates to the user interface for peer
  instruction problems. These updates include a change to the problem heading,
  which now reads "Peer Instruction Question", and the addition of an "Explain
  to other students why you chose this answer" cue for the final answer text
  box.
