* Learners who are taking courses on edx.org or on edX Edge can now highlight
  text and take notes while they progress through a course. Course teams can
  enable notes for their courses by setting the **Enable Student
  Notes** advanced setting to ``true``. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Notes Tool` in the *Building and Running an edX
  Course* guide, or :ref:`learners:SFD Notes` in the *EdX Learner's Guide*.

* The LMS now supports internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of
  static user interface text in XBlocks. You use the GNU ``gettext`` Portable
  Object (PO) file format to provide translated text strings for an XBlock's "chrome"
  or "labels". For more information, see :ref:`EdX Learning Management System as
  an XBlock Runtime` in the Open edX XBlock Tutorial.
