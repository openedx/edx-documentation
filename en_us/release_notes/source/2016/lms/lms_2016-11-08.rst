This release resolves an issue where tasks that were in progress on the **Data
Download** tab in the Instructor Dashboard (such as generating problem
reports) did not display in the table of pending tasks. The **Pending Tasks**
table now correctly displays tasks that are in progress. (:jira:`TNL-5858`)
