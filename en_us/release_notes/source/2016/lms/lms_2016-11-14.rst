Learners who have not specifically selected a time zone in their edX account
settings now see times and dates on their dashboards, in the body of their
courses, and on their **Progress** pages in the time zone that their browser
specifies. Browser dates and times appear in military time and are followed by
a time zone indicator: for example, 17:00 Sept 5, 2016 IOT. Other dates and
times in their courses appear in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and do not
have a time zone indicator.
