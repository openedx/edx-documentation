* EdX has updated the target of its **Skip to Content** links so that keyboard
  and screen reader users can more easily navigate to the unique content on
  each page. Special consideration was made to determine what constitutes the
  main content in each of our templates. This update also defines a ``<main>``
  element for each edX template. Screen reader users can use the ``<main>``
  element as a page landmark.

* Learners who selected the "next" arrow button but did not have access to the
  following unit received a "Page not found" error message. This problem has
  been resolved. The "next" arrow button is now available only if the learner
  has access to the following unit. (TNL-4460)
