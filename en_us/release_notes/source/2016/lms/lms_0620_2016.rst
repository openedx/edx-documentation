* The edX video player now renders all transcript files as plain text. HTML
  markup, including character entities such as ``&nbsp;`` and styling such as
  bold (strong) or italic (emphasis), is now removed from each transcript .srt
  file before the transcript plays for a video component.

  In addition, the indication for the selected speed and transcript language is
  now clearer when a user's operating system is in high contrast mode.

* In course discussions, large images could sometimes exceed the width of the

  has been resolved. (:jira:`TNL-4778`)

* In course discussions, learners can no longer vote for or report their own
  posts. (:jira:`TNL-4703`)
