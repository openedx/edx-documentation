* To anticipate and answer learners' questions about certificate availability,
  the **Progress** page now includes the following message for learners who
  are enrolled in the audit track.

  "You are enrolled in the audit track for this course. The audit track does
  not include a certificate."

* An error in the way that responses to questions were presented in the course
  discussions has been corrected. The error caused responses to retain the
  "marked as answer {time frame} by {username}" message even after a discussion
  moderator or the original poster had unmarked them. This message no longer
  appears for responses that have been unmarked. (:jira:`TNL-4392`)

  For more information about marking answers as correct, see
  :ref:`openlearners:Answer Questions`.

* The footer for the edx.org website includes a set of links to different
  social media sites. To give these options more structural meaning for people
  who use screen readers to visit the site, these links are now organized into
  a list instead of a collection of links.

* The edX video player no longer renders all transcript files, including HTML
  markup, as plain text. This change reverts (:jira:`AC-454`), which was
  released during the week of 20 June 2016. The accessibility issues that
  AC-454 was intended to resolve will be addressed in a future release.
