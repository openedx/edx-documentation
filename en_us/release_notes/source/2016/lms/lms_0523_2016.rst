This release includes a number of improvements to the appearance and
accessibility of controls in the edX LMS.

* When learners who use high contrast mode on their systems select a page such
  as **Course** or **Discussion**, the selected page is now clearly
  distinguishable from the other pages. (:jira:`AC-386`)

* The editing options for circuit schematic builder problems, including the
  tools to show or hide the grid display, cut, copy, and paste, now include
  accessible labels. Screenreaders can now properly identify these controls,
  and when a learner moves the pointer over any of the controls, an identifying
  tooltip now appears. (:jira:`AC-399`)

* The **Calculator** control has been enhanced so that it appears for learners
  who use high contrast mode on their systems. (:jira:`AC-405`)

* The video player now includes accessible labels for every control.
  Screenreaders can now properly identify every control, and when a learner
  moves the pointer over any control, an identifying tooltip now appears.
  (:jira:`AC-406`, :jira:`AC-407`)

* On wiki article pages, a page layout error has been corrected. Previously,
  the options for an article, including **View**, **Edit**, and **Settings**,
  appeared in the shaded area below the article rather than next to it.
