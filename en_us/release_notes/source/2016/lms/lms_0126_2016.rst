* The peer instruction tool is now available. With this tool, learners select
  an answer for a multiple-choice question and provide an explanation for the
  answer that they select. Learners can then review the answers and
  explanations that other learners have provided for the same question, and can
  change their answers before they submit a final response. Histograms provide
  information about the answers that learners select.

  For more information about how learners complete these assignments, see
  :ref:`learners:interactive_multiple_choice` in the *EdX Learner's Guide* or
  :ref:`openlearners:interactive_multiple_choice` in the *Open edX Learner's
  Guide*.

* When a learner used the edX platform in a right-to-left language, such as
  Arabic, the draggable options in drag and drop problems were not visible.
  This problem has been fixed.
