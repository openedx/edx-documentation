Navigation Improvements
=======================

Several improvements have been made to LMS navigation.

* Learners can now use the left-pointing and right-pointing arrow buttons at
  the ends of the learning sequence to move back to the previous unit or
  forward to the next unit.

* When learners hold their mouse pointers over or when screen readers read each
  unit in the sequence, only the unit's title is displayed or read. Previously,
  the titles of the unit and of all its components were displayed or read.

* When learners return to a course, they can open the **Course** page directly.
  Previously, learners had to select the **Resume Course** page to show course
  content.

Signing in with Microsoft Online Accounts
=========================================

Learners can now sign into the LMS using their Microsoft® online accounts. The
Microsoft sign in button is available along with buttons for signing in with
Facebook® and Google® online accounts.
