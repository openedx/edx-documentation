Performance Improvements for Grade Computations
===============================================

Over the last two months, a series of incremental improvements have been made
to grade computations. As a result, system performance for loading the learner
**Progress** page has increased significantly over the past three weeks.

The graph that follows shows the effect of the first of these changes, which
released at approximately 1:00 pm EDT on 29 Jun 2016. The graph shows a
significant drop in response time, from eight seconds to approximately four
seconds, immediately after the initial phase of the work was released.

  :alt: Graph showing that the median load duration dropped from over two
    seconds to approximately one second. The load duration for the 95th and
    99th percentiles were even more significant, dropping from over eight
    seconds to approximately four.

Subsequent performance improvements were then made that built upon this initial
transformative change.

The graph that follows shows a comparison of how long it took to load the page,
in seconds, for the two week period from 29 Jul 2016 to 11 Aug 2016 to the
period two weeks immediately prior. The graph on the top compares median
durations, and the graph on the bottom compares 95th percentile durations for
these time periods.

.. image:: /Images/progress_on_progress.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Top graph shows matching trend lines of between 0.55 and 0.6 seconds
   for median load time over the first five days, then a drop of 0.15 seconds
   on 2 Aug and a general trend down to 0.35 seconds on 11 Aug. For 95th
   percentile values, trend lines matched at around 1.5 for the first five
   days, followed by a more gradual drop to under 1 on 11 Aug 15.

Other Changes
===============================================

* The **Staff Debug Info** option now appears only next to assessment types
  that allow course team members to reset the number of attempts or rescore the
  problem, such as the core CAPA problem types. (:jira:`SOL-1809`)

* This release includes changes to enhance the accessibility of page navigation
  elements. Button elements now replace links and "href" elements where
  appropriate. (:jira:`AC-530`)

* An error that prevented learners from being able to preview discussion posts
  has been resolved. Posts, including those with Markdown formatting, can now
  be previewed. (:jira:`TNL-5198`)
