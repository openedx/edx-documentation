Movable Closed Captions
========================

Those who choose to view the closed captioning for a video can now move the
captions to a different place on the video. When you move the mouse pointer
over the caption control, the pointer now changes to a four-headed arrow. You
can then drag the caption and drop it onto another part of the video screen.

The following images show an example of captions being moved.

Sorting by Date for Discussion Posts
=========================================

A problem with the method used to sort discussion posts in web browsers is now
fixed. Previously, when a learner sorted discussion posts **by recent
activity** in a web browser, the discussion posts were sorted by creation date
rather than last activity date. Discussion posts are now sorted correctly.
