* The grade report and the problem grade report include two new values. "Not
  Attempted" indicates that a learner has not attempted the problem. "Not
  Available" indicates that the problem was not available to learners, such as
  when a problem is available only for a particular cohort. For more
  information, see :ref:`Access_grades`. (:jira:`TNL-5577`)

* Permissions for the Staff role have been updated. Course team members with
  the Staff role can now access and modify grades for individual learners.
  Course team members with the Admin role can access and modify grades for all
  learners in a course. For more information, see :ref:`Administrative Team
  Roles`. (:jira:`TNL-5907`)

* On the learner **Progress** page, the details in the visual chart are now
  accessible to keyboard and screen reader users. (:jira:`TNL-5891`)
