* When videos were viewed in high contrast mode, the video playback slider and
  the volume slider were not visible. This problem has been resolved.

* To allow learners to make informed decisions about which discussion posts to
  expand and read, discussions now offer a post listing view and a post details
  view. In the post listing view, learners see a list that includes the title
  and approximately one line of each post.

  When a learner selects a post, the post, comments, and responses open in the
  post details view. Learners can return to the post listing view by selecting
  the **All Posts** link in the post details view.

  Both views are available in inline discussions, on the **Teams** page, and on
  the **Discussions** page, creating a consistent discussion experience in all
  three locations.
