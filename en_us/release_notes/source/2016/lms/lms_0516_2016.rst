* New columns for city and country have been added to the student profile
  report. (OSPR-1155)

  For more information about the student profile report, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Columns in the Student Profile Report` in the
  *Building and Running an edX Course* guide, or, for Open edX installations,
  :ref:`opencoursestaff:Columns in the Student Profile Report` in the *Building
  and Running an Open edX Course* guide.

* The learner dashboard now offers two pages. The **Courses** page, which
  learners see by default, lists all of the courses that learners are enrolled
  in. The new **Programs** page lists the programs that learners are enrolled
  in. This page also indicates learner progress in each of the programs in
  which they are participating.

    :alt: The Programs page for a learner who is enrolled in three XSeries
        programs. In one of the programs, that learner has earned one
        certificate, but has not yet earned certificates in either of the
        other two.

  For more information, see the `XSeries Programs Page`_ announcement on the
  edX partner portal.

* To improve the experience of learners who use screen readers, the learner
  dashboard now provides additional, course specific context for each of the
  **Upgrade to Verified** or **View XSeries Details** options that appear on
  this page. (ECOM-4269, ECOM-4270)

* A UTF-8 character encoding error that prevented some course teams from
  downloading the CSV file of certificates issued on the instructor dashboard
  has been corrected. (:jira:`CRI-57`)
