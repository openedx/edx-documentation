* In open response assessments, when you override a learner's grade by
  performing a staff assessment, any steps that the learner did not complete
  for the assignment are now marked as complete. Previously, steps that
  required action from the learner remained open and the assignment was left
  in an incomplete state. (:jira:`TNL-4696`)

  For more information about overriding a learner's grade in an ORA assignment,
  see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Override a learner assessment grade`.

* For courses that require ID verification, learners who have valid
  verifications are no longer prompted to renew their verifications.
