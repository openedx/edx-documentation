* A new Bookmarks feature allows learners to add a bookmark to any unit page so
  that they can easily find the page later. On the **My Bookmarks** page,
  learners can see the list of bookmarks they added either in the individual
  unit, or throughout the course. For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD
  Bookmarks` in the *EdX Learner's Guide* or :ref:`openlearners:SFD Bookmarks`
  in the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.

* The "legacy" Instructor Dashboard is no longer available.

* The video player now includes closed captions. Users can view closed captions
  and transcripts either separately or at the same time. Currently, closed
  captions and transcripts use the same file.

* To increase accessibility, color contrast has been enhanced for some elements
  of the Instructor Dashboard and the learner **Progress** page. (AC-177 and
  AC-178)

* In the video player, users can now press the Enter key or the space bar to
  show or hide transcripts. (AC-296)

  problems has been fixed. (TNL-2896)
