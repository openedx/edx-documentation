.. Add release notes for the lms audience in RST format here.
.. The edX documentation team will include this file in the index
.. file for the upcoming release. If you add more than one note, format the
.. notes as a bulleted list by preceding each note with an asterisk.
..
.. If your release note change is associated with a JIRA item, add the
.. JIRA ticket number at the end of your item.
..
.. For example:
..
.. To improve the experience of learners who use screen readers, the
.. learner dashboard now provides additional, course specific context for
.. each of the Upgrade to Verified or View XSeries Details options that
.. appear on this page. (:jira:`ECOM-4269`, :jira:`ECOM-4270`)
..

* Learners can now specify their local time zones in their account settings. If
  a learner sets a time zone, that learner sees all course dates and times
  displayed in the specified time zone rather than in UTC. In Studio, course
  teams continue to set dates in UTC. (:jira:`TNL-4594`)

* Program cards on the learner dashboard's **Programs** page now link to
  program details pages. On these new pages, learners will be able to view more
  information about a specific program, enroll in program courses, view any
  certificates that they have earned, and view their progress through the
  program. (:jira:`ECOM-3193`)

* The **How it Works**, **Find Courses**, and **Schools & Partners** links no
  longer appear on the **Account Settings** page for learners. **Courses** and
  **Programs** are now the only links at the top of the **Account Settings**
  page. (:jira:`ECOM-4787`)

* This release resolves an error that prevented learners from seeing the number
  of votes that their own discussion posts had received. (:jira:`TNL-5011`)

.. Add doc links for the time zone note.
