* All course updates, including those added on the same date, now appear in
  reverse chronological order (most recent first). Previously, if several
  updates were added on the same date, they were listed in chronological
  order. (:jira:`TNL-4204`)

* When CAPA (computer assisted personalized approach) problems display in right-
  to-left languages, math equation response fields now correctly allow learners
  to input mathematical or scientific expressions from left to right.

Accessibility
===============

Various accessibility enhancements were made in the LMS.

* To improve navigation for screen reader users, checkboxes on the
  **Certificates** page on the instructor dashboard are now programmatically
  grouped so that screen readers identify these options as a group.
  (:jira:`AC-543`)

* To improve accessibility and readability by increasing contrast, edX has
  modified the pink color used in Studio and the LMS. This color is used in
  user interface elements such as the **View Unit in Studio** and the **Staff
  Debug Info** buttons. (:jira:`AC-549`)
