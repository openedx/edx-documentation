* For sites that are running an Open edX instance, the Dogwood release is now
  available. Dogwood, the fourth release of the Open edX platform, contains new
  features for learners, course teams, and developers. For more information,
  see the :ref:`openreleasenotes:Open edX Dogwood Release` or this `Dogwood
  blog post`_ on the Open edX portal.

* The OAuth 2.0 provider library has been updated to version 0.5.0. This update
  includes support for the client credentials grant.

* In this release, Ruby has been removed from the edx-platform repository. As a
  result, the ``prereqs`` paver command no longer installs the prerequisite
  environment for Ruby, and the edxapp user on new instances of Devstack will
  no longer have ``rbenv`` in the search path. However, discussion forums use
  Ruby, and the forums user continues to have ``rbenv`` in the search path.

* An error that prevented the Django admin ``GlobalStatusMessage`` view from
  displaying a list of status messages has been corrected.
  ``ConfigurationModelAdmin.get_readonly_fields`` now returns
  ``coursemessage_set`` as a field name. (TNL-4048)
