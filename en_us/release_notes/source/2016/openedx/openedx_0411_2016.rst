Badges for Custom Course Events
===============================

In addition to offering badges for course completion, Open edX instances can
now award badges to learners for customized course events. Examples of course
events are: enrolling in a certain number of courses, completing a certain
number of courses, or completing a specific list of courses. For more
information, see
:ref:`installation:Create Course Event Badges` and
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Enable Badges in Course`.

====================
Deprecated REST APIs

The mobile, course structure, and profile images REST web services are
deprecated.

* Use the ``/api/courses/v1/courses/`` web service instead of the deprecated
  mobile and course structure web services.

* Use the ``/api/user/v1/accounts/`` web service instead of the deprecated
  profile image web service.
