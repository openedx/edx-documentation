Third party authentication providers are now configured by site. You can now
configure each of the sites that are set up for your Open edX installation to
use a different third party authentication identity provider.

If you have configured your Open edX installation to act as a SAML service
provider, when you upgrade to this release all configuration settings apply
only to the default site. You must now configure each of your other sites
separately. For more information, see :ref:`installation:Enabling Third Party
Authentication`.
