On 5 May 2016, a change to the ``courseware_studentmodulehistory`` database
table was released to the edx-platform repository. This change requires a new
database configuration and offers an optional data migration. The change
affects all Open edX installations that follow master.  If you are responsible
for maintaining an Open edX instance, including a devstack, fullstack, or
production installation, you must prepare for this change before you upgrade to
the 5 May 2016 version of master.

.. note:: No changes are required or supported at this time for Open edX
  installations that use the **Dogwood** release.

For information about the change to the ``courseware_studentmodulehistory``
database table and the options for completing the required and optional
procedures, see :ref:`openreleasenotes:Replacing CSMH`.
