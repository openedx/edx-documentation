Settings for Querystring Authentication
=======================================

You can now choose whether to use querystring authentication for assets served
from AWS S3. To disable querystring authentication, you define two new
settings. You set ``AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH`` to False, and then set
``AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN`` to your S3 domain value. If you disable querystring
authentication, the URLs for course assets no longer include the S3 query
strings, and are significantly reduced in length.
