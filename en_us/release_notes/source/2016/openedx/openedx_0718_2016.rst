* EdX has improved the overall performance of computing grades, which results
  in a 75% performance improvement in loading the learner **Progress** page.
  The Eucalyptus release will include these performance changes.

* For coupons, validation during the coupon creation process has been improved.
  This release also includes small improvements to the coupon creation user
  interface.

* The ``XBlockDisableConfig`` model and the ``ENABLE_DISABLING_XBLOCK_TYPES``,
  ``DEPRECATED_BLOCK_TYPES``, and ``DEPRECATED_ADVANCED_COMPONENT_TYPES``
  settings are being transitioned to the new ``XBlockConfiguration`` and
  ``XBlockStudioConfiguration`` models. The Studio deprecation and LMS
  disabling functionality have already transitioned. In the near future,
  metadata about XBlock state will also transition, and the
  ``XBlockDisableConfig`` model and associated settings will be deleted.

  The Eucalyptus release will **not** include these changes.
