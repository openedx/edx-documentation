This release includes a new process for enabling or disabling the bulk email
feature. You now use the Django administration console to change a setting,
rather than editing different configuration files.

As a result of this change, the bulk email feature is disabled for any site
that is closely following the master version of edx-platform until you
manually re-enable it.

For more information, see :ref:`openreleasenotes:Enable Bulk Email`.
