Open edX platform users who have installed the E-Commerce service can now
create coupons to give their learners discounts on courses that have fees.
Coupons can be single-user or multi-user and can be valid for just one course
or for multiple courses.

For more information, see :ref:`installation:Create and Manage Coupons` in
the *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform* guide.
