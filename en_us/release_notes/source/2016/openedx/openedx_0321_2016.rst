* The LMS now supports internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of
  static user interface text in XBlocks. You use the GNU ``gettext`` Portable
  Object (PO) file format to provide translated text strings for an XBlock's
  "chrome" or "labels". For more information, see :ref:`EdX Learning Management
  System as an XBlock Runtime` in the Open edX XBlock Tutorial.
