An update is coming to the learner dashboard. Instead of just one page, the
dashboard will have a default **Courses** page that resembles the current
dashboard, and will also have a **Programs** page that provides learners with
easy access to information about their XSeries Programs. If learners are
enrolled in any course that is part of an XSeries Program, they will see the
XSeries Program listed on this page. For more information, see `Coming Soon
Programs Page`_.
