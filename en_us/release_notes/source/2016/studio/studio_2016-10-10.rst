* When you add a problem component to a unit by selecting **Problem** and then
  **Advanced**, the different versions of the drag and drop problem type
  are now more clearly labeled. To use the more recently added, fully supported
  problem type, you select **Drag and Drop**. To use the previous version,
  which is not accessible or usable on mobile devices, you select **Drag and
  Drop (Deprecated Version)**. (:jira:`SOL-1612`)

  For more information, see :ref:`drag_and_drop_problem`.

* When you add a randomized content block to a course, the **Scored** field is
  no longer available as an editable setting for this component type. This
  field was never used, and did not have any effect on how the resulting
  problem was scored. Grading for randomized content block components, like all
  other components, is defined in the subsection. (:jira:`TNL-4171`)

  For more information, see :ref:`Randomized Content Blocks`.

* In a video component, an updated message appears if you select an additional
  language from the **Transcript Languages** list, but do not also upload the
  corresponding .srt file: "There is no transcript file associated with the
  {name} language." (:jira:`TNL-5200`)

* This release corrects an error that prevented :ref:`annotation tool
  <Annotation>` problems from being saved. The ``target.src`` value in the
  request is now correctly identified as a URL.
