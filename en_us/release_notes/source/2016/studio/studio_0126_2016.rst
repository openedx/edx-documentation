* The peer instruction tool is now available. With this tool, you set up a
  multiple choice question and provide a sample explanation for why each of the
  answer choices might be the correct one. Learners then select an answer,
  provide their own explanation for the answer they selected, and then view the
  answers and explanations that other learners have provided before selecting a
  final answer.

  For more information about how course teams set up these assignments, see

  edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:UBC Peer Instruction` in *Building and
  Running an Open edX Course*.
