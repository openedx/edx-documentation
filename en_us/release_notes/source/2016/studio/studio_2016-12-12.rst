Course team members with either the Admin or Staff role can now activate or
disable course certificates in Studio. Previously, activating or disabling
certificates could only be done by edX partner managers. (:jira:`TNL-6086`) For
information about setting up course certificates, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Setting Up Course Certificates`.

In Custom JavaScript Display and Grading problems (also called Custom
JavaScript  or JavaScript Input problems), you can now specify a ``title``
attribute within the ``jsinput`` tag. This title is used as the title
attribute on the generated IFrame and should typically match the title tag of
the HTML that is hosted within the IFrame. (:jira:`TNL-6044`). For more
information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Custom JavaScript`.
