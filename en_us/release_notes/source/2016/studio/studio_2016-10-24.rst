* A new "staff only" option is available for the custom pages that you add to
  your course. You can now define a new setting, **Hide Page from Learners**,
  to identify content that should only be available to members of the course
  team who have the Staff or Admin role.

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding Pages to a Course`
  in *Building and Running an edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Adding Pages
  to a Course` in *Building and Running an Open edX Course*.
  (:jira:`OSPR-1327`)

* You can now define additional correct answers for numerical input problems in
  the same way that you can for text input problems. In the simple editor,
  additional correct answers are identified by the ``"or="`` Markdown. In the
  advanced editor, additional correct answers are added in an ``<
  additional_answer>`` OLX element.
