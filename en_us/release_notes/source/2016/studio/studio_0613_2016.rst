If you delete the default title text in the **Display Name** setting for a
problem, and do not enter a new title, the problem now displays the word
"problem" as its title. If you deleted the title text for problems in existing
courses, and did not enter new titles, those problems now display "problem" as
their titles. (:jira:`FEDX-198`)
