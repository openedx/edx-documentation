For courses running on edx.org, a new procedure for uploading course About
videos is now ready for use. The edX media team has developed a process that
automates hosting and encoding for your About videos. For more information,
see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Add a Course Video` in the *Building and Running
an edX Course* guide.
