* Course teams that use proctored exams in their courses can now use a new
  option on the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio to control whether verified
  learners must take proctored exams with online proctoring. Previously,
  verified learners could opt out of taking proctored exams with online
  proctoring, with the understanding that this choice made them ineligible for
  course credit. Now, when course teams set the **Allow Opting Out of
  Proctored Exams** option to ``false``, verified learners no longer have the
  ability to choose to take proctored exams without online proctoring.
  (:jira:`TNL-5084`) For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Allow
  Opting Out of Proctored Exams` in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

* On the **Certificates** settings page in Studio, the Help text in the sidebar
  now correctly indicates that activation of configured certificates is done by
  edX partner managers rather than by course team members.
