Date Validation for Course Updates
=========================================

When course teams add a course update in Studio, the system now validates the
value entered as the date of the update. Previously, course teams could enter
any value in the **Date** field, including text strings or null values.
However, the LMS could not successfully display an update unless it had a valid
date. Learners received an error message on the course **Home** page instead of
the update.

Now, when a course team member saves an update, Studio verifies that the
**Date** field contains a valid date. (TNL-4115)
