HTML headings on the course **Home** page have been reorganized to improve
accessibility. The structure of the **Home** page now uses heading levels 1-5
(``<h1>â€“<h5>``). Course teams who want to add headings in the body of their
announcements can use heading level 6 (``<h6>``). For more information, see
:ref:`Add a Course Update`.
