* On the **Video Uploads** page in Studio (**Content > Video Uploads**), you can
  now remove videos from the list of previously uploaded videos without
  affecting course content that uses the video ID of successfully uploaded
  videos. (:JIRA:`TNL-5899`) For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Delete Videos from Upload Page` in the *Building
  and Running an edX Course* guide.

* When you use the course outline in Studio to develop your course, you can
  now duplicate existing units, subsections, and sections. (:JIRA:`TNL-5798`,
  :JIRA:`TNL-5797`) Duplicated items inherit the release date of the block
  that they are duplicated from, but you must explicitly publish duplicated
  subsections and units before they are visible to learners. For more
  information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Add Content in the Course Outline`
  in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.
