* Course teams that add non-English videos to a course and want to provide
  English transcripts can now select English from the transcript language list.
  (:jira:`TNL-4763`)

* This release includes the following improvements to drag and drop problems.

  * A new, optional assessment mode requires learners to drop all draggable
    items before receiving feedback, and allows course teams to restrict the
    number of attempts.

  * Draggable items can now match more than one target zone.

  * Target zones can now align draggable items after learners drop them.

  * Draggable items no longer accept numeric input when learners drop them on
    target zones.

  For updated documentation, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem` in *Building and Running an
  edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem` in *Building
  and Running an Open edX Course*.

* To ensure that course IDs are unique identifiers, the edit check performed
  for new courses is now case insensitive. As a result, you can no longer
  create an "edx demox 1" course if an "edX DemoX 1" course already exists.
