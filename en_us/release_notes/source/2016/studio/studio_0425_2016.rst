==============================
New Drag and Drop Problem Type
==============================

A new drag and drop problem type is now available. This mobile-ready,
accessible version replaces the older drag and drop problem type and should be
used in any new course development. Existing courses that use the older drag
and drop problem type are not affected. However, if you re-run a course that
uses the older drag and drop problem type, you should replace these problems
with the new version.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem` in the
*Building and Running an edX Course* guide. Analytics events for the new drag
and drop problem type are described in :ref:`data:Drag and Drop Events` in the
*EdX Research Guide*.

Other Changes
==============

* Previously, if course teams added more than one ORA component in a single
  unit in Studio, learners were not able to correctly submit responses. This
  issue is now resolved. (TNL-4155)

* In the ORA data report that is generated from the **Data Download** page of
  the instructor dashboard, comments that are added during peer or staff
  grading of responses now display in the order that they appear in the ORA
  assignment. (TNL-4352)

* In the problem grade report that is generated from the **Data Download** page
  of the instructor dashboard, problems now display in the order that they
  appear in the course. (OSPR-1203)
