* To improve accessibility and readability by increasing contrast, edX has
  adjusted some colors in Studio and the LMS. The change is most noticeable for
  buttons that appear in green or blue. For example, the following image shows
  the options for new components in Studio before and after this change.

* The edX tabbed component has been updated to follow World Wide Web Consortium
  (W3C) recommendations and to be more accessible. Learners can navigate the
  individual tabs with the arrow keys, while the Enter and Spacebar keys
  activate the tab, and the Tab key enters the tab panel content. This tabbed
  component is currently used in the teams feature and the learner profile, and
  will be added to more areas of the edX platform. (:jira:`AC-486`)
