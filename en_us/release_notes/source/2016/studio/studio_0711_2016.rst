To ensure that every text input problem includes a correct answer value, an
edit check has been added to the advanced editor. These problems are now
checked for an answer attribute value.

Previously, course team members could leave the answer attribute empty
(``<stringresponse answer=" " type="ci" >``), which resulted in a question
that learners could not answer correctly. (:jira:`TNL-4141`)
