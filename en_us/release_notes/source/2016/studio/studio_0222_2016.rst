* A problem that caused a status of "Published, not yet released" to be visible
  for sections in self-paced courses has been fixed. (ECOM-3615)

* The "randomize" component, previously a little-used provisional tool, is now
  deprecated. To provide randomized content, you can continue to use the fully
  supported Content Libraries tool to create randomized content blocks. For
  more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Randomized Content Blocks`.

  If an instructor accesses a course that still uses the older randomize
  component, Studio displays the message "This course uses features that are no
  longer supported".
