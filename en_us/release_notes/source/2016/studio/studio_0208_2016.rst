========================
Subsection Prerequisites
========================


Course teams can now control the visibility of subsections based on the scores
that learners earn in other subsections. You can use the subsection
prerequisite control to prevent learners from viewing content before they earn
a minimum score in the exams for previous content. For more information, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:configuring_prerequisite_content` in `Building and
Running an edX Course` or
:ref:`opencoursestaff:configuring_prerequisite_content` in `Building and
Running an Open edX Course`.

=======================================================
Accessibility Enhancements for HTML Component Templates
=======================================================

This release includes additional changes to HTML components to ensure that all
headings on a course page are rendered correctly by screen readers. Following
the removal of the Heading 1 and Heading 2 options from the :ref:`HTML
component visual editor<html_heading_levels>`, all of the templates for HTML
components have been updated to include headings beginning with Heading 3. This
release also includes styling and scalability changes to the toolbar icons in
the HTML component visual editor.
