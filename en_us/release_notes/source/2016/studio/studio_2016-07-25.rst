.. learner dashboard now provides additional, course specific context for
.. each of the Upgrade to Verified or View XSeries Details options that
.. appear on this page. (:jira:`ECOM-4269`, :jira:`ECOM-4270`)
..

* Course teams can now hide the contents of a subsection after the subsection's
  due date has passed without affecting earned grades. Subsections that are
  hidden in this way remain in the course navigation, but after the subsection
  due date, learners cannot access the content. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Hide a Subsection from Students` in *Building and
  Running an edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Hide a Subsection from
  Students` in *Building and Running an Open edX Course*. (:jira:`TNL-4906`)

* This release resolves an error that affected course exports made from edx.org
  from 13 July through 26 July 2016. Discussion posts were not exported
  correctly, and erroneous titles were given to the discussion components. Any
  export file made for an edx.org course between those dates (inclusive) should
  be replaced with an export file created either before or after that date
  range. (:jira:`TNL-5001`)

.. TODO: add doc links.
