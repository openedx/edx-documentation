Discussion posts are now identified as having been read when you interact with
a post in the edX mobile app. Previously, interactions such as adding a
response or comment to a post, or answering a question or marking a question as
answered, caused the post to be identified as unread. (:jira:`MA-2139`)

For answers to frequently asked questions about the mobile app, see the
:ref:`learners:SFD Mobile` section in the *EdX Learner's Guide*, or, for
Open edX installations, see the :ref:`openlearners:SFD Mobile` section in
the *Open edX Learner's Guide*.
