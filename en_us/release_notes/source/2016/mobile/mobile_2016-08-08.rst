Version 2.6.2 of the edX app for Android is now available. This version of the
mobile app allows learners to browse edX courses without creating an edX
account and without logging in. Learners can register for an edX account or
sign in from the about page for any course. Other improvements in this version
include accessibility fixes to the video player.

You can download the free Android edX mobile app from `Google Play`_.
