The latest version of the edX app (version 2.0.0) for Android smartphones is
now available. Learners who access edX courses using Android phones will now
have a more complete course experience. They can now use the app to view HTML
and text components, and complete assignments that consist of the basic
assessment types (checkbox, dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical
input).
