Version 2.6 of the edX app for iOS is now available. This version of the mobile
app allows learners to browse edX courses without creating an edX account and
without logging in. Learners can register for an edX account or sign in from the
about page for any course. Other improvements in this version include
accessibility fixes to the video player.

You can download the latest version of the free iOS edX mobile app from the
iTunes app store.
