Individual Learner Data in Insights
=====================================

Data for individual learners is now available in edX Insights. Activity
metrics for the past week, including the number of videos viewed, discussion
contributions made, and problems attempted, are now available for every
enrolled learner.

The learner roster and key activity report shows how learners are doing in
relation to their peers. In the example learner roster and key activity report
below, the numbered callouts illustrate the color and font cues that identify a
percentile range for each metric.

     each enrolled learner for the past week, including the number of videos
     viewed, discussion contributions made, and problems attempted.

#. Counts that are underlined and in red are in the 15th percentile or below,
   and might indicate that a learner is falling behind.

#. Counts in the 16th-84th percentiles appear in normal black font.

#. Counts in the 85th percentile or above appear in bold, green font, and
   might indicate that a learner is doing particularly well.

Select any learner's username in the learner roster and key activity report to
open a chart and review a timeline of that learner's daily activity throughout
the course.

Insights* guide.


==============================
Research Data Exchange Program
==============================

The research data exchange (RDX) program provides a way for edX charter member
organizations to access data for courses run by other participating
organizations. Through this program, obfuscated data is made available to
research teams who are conducting approved educational research studies.

For more information about RDX, including how organizations can apply to
participate and how researchers can request data for a study, see the `Research
page`_ on the edX partner portal.

For more information about how to access RDX data packages and how the data is
obfuscated, see the :ref:`data:Research Data Exchange` section in the *EdX
Research Guide*.
