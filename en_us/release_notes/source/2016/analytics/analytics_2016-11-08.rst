In Insights, the Weekly Student Engagement chart and the Content Engagement
Breakdown report now include discussion participation counts for each week.
Learners who added a post, a response, or a comment are included in this count.
The "Participated in Discussions Last Week" metric reports the number of unique
users who added a post, response, or comment to any course discussion topic in
the last week, and also provides this value as a percentage of currently
enrolled students.

For more information, see the `Engagement Activity`_ section in the *Using edX
Insights* guide.
