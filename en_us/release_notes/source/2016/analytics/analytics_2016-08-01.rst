In Insights, the Daily Student Enrollment chart and the Enrollment Over Time
report now include counts for each of the enrollment options and tracks that
are offered for your course. Specifically, enrollment graphs now show audit
track enrollments separately from honor track enrollments, which are no longer
offered. Because of this change, enrollment options and tracks for courses that
run after December 2015 can include audit, verified, verified with credit, and
professional. Enrollment tracks for courses that ended before December 2015
might also include honor.

For more information, see the `Enrollment Activity`_ section in the *Using edX
Insights* guide.
