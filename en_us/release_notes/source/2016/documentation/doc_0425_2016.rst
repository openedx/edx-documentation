New Drag and Drop Problem Type
=================================

The *Building and Running an edX Course* and *Building and Running an Open edX
Course* guides now include information about the new drag and drop problem
type. This new drag and drop problem type is more flexible and accessible, and
should be used instead of the deprecated version. For more information, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem` in the *Building and Running
an edX Course* guide or :ref:`opencoursestaff:drag_and_drop_problem` in the
*Building and Running an Open edX Course* guide.

Analytics events for the new drag and drop problem type are described in
:ref:`data:Drag and Drop Events` in the *EdX Research Guide*.

Open edX sites can customize the styling of the new drag and drop problem type.
For more information, see :ref:`installation:styling_drag_and_drop_problems` in
