The search feature for edX documentation includes two improvements.

* You can now include punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters in
  search terms. For example, you can search for terms such as "A/B testing" or
  "user_id."

* The snippet of content in search results no longer shows ``.. include::`` for
  some results. Those search results now show a sample of the actual
  documentation content in the results.
