A new section in the *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX
Platform* guide describes how to configure an Open edX instance to serve course
assets from a content delivery network (CDN) instead of directly from your Open
edX instance. Using a CDN offloads the work required to deliver assets from
your Open edX instance. For more information, see :ref:`installation:Enabling a
CDN for Course Assets`.
