==================================
Documentation for Open edX Users
==================================

* Some sections of the *Open EdX Developer's Guide* have been reorganized. The
  "Writing Good Code" section now includes a new subsection,
  :ref:`opendevelopers:Safe Templates`, as well as existing subsections
  :ref:`opendevelopers:Accessibility Guidelines for Developers`,
  :ref:`opendevelopers:i18n`, and :ref:`opendevelopers:Django Good Practices`.
  If you have bookmarked existing pages in this guide, you should visit the
  updated version to locate and re-bookmark pages in the new structure.

* The *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform* guide has
  been reorganized. Improvements include a streamlined table of contents which
  combines various "installing" and "configuring" sections for developer stack
  and full stack options under two new top level sections: :ref:`Installing
  and Starting the Open edX Platform` and :ref:`Configuring the Open edX
  Platform`. If you have bookmarked existing pages in this guide, you should
  visit the updated version to locate and re-bookmark pages in the new
  structure.

* The *Building and Running an Open edX Course* guide now includes the same
  :ref:`opencoursestaff:Glossary` that is included in the *Building and Running
  an edX Course* guide.
