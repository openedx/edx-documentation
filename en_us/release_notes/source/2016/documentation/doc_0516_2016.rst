* The *Open edX Platform APIs* guide has been updated with documentation for
  the `courses API`_.

* The *EdX Research Guide* has been reorganized. All of the reference
  information about the data stored in SQL and noSQL databases is presented
  first, in a :ref:`data:Data Reference` section. This section is followed by
  information that is more specifically applicable to data czars at edX partner
  institutions. Bookmarks to the information for data czars might need to be
  updated.
