A note has been added to alert course teams to a best practice for using open
response (ORA) assignments. Each course unit must contain only one ORA
assignment. Multiple ORA assignments in a unit cause errors when learners
submit peer assessments.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Best Practices for ORA` in
the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Best
Practices for ORA` in the *Building and Running an Open edX Course* guide.
