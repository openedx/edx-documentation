The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

* Course teams will soon be able to access student performance data in edX
  Insights. EdX Insights will report all of the answers that students submit for
  assigned questions, and provide aggregated performance data for graded
  assignments and problems.

* Open response assessments (ORA) in edx.org and edge.edx.org courses will soon
support multiple prompts.

* Course teams will soon be able to use new component types to include Google
  Calendars and Google Drive documents in courseware.
