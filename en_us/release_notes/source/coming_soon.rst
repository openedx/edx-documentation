****************************************
New Drag and Drop Problem Type
****************************************

A new drag and drop problem type is currently under development. The
new drag and drop problem type is much easier to create, is more
accessible, and works on mobile devices. The new problem type will
eventually replace the current drag and drop problem type for new
course content. The new drag and drop problem type will not affect
existing courses that include drag and drop problems created using the
older problem type.
