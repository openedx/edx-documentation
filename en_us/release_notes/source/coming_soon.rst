****************************************
Notetaking Feature for Learners
****************************************

A feature that gives learners the ability to highlight course content and make
notes while they take a course will soon be enabled for all courses on the
edx.org and edge.edx.org websites. Learners who use this feature will be able
to review their notes either in the course content or listed on a new, separate
**Notes** page in the course.
