To improve accessibility, corrections were made to several of the edX website
pages. The changes correct the use of semantic elements, make labels
accessible, and order headings logically. Style changes across the platform
were also made to increase color contrast. (ECOM-1303, ECOM-1304, ECOM-1305,
UX-1949)

  their certificate track. This problem has been fixed. (ECOM-1088)

  available bandwidth. This problem has been fixed. (TNL-1202)

People who have registered, but not yet activated, an `edX.org`_ account can now

* Students who had enrolled in a verified course were erroneously prompted to
  verify their identity if their edX verification expired after the course's
  verification deadline. This problem is resolved. (ECOM-864)

* Students using Internet Explorer 9 without Flash installed were able to click
  disabled buttons and proceed through the verification process, though no
  photo was taken. Students now cannot proceed until they install Flash.
