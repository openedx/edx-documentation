* Students who had enrolled in a verified course were erroneously prompted to
  verify their identity if their edX verification expired after the course's
  verification deadline. This problem is resolved. (ECOM-864)

* Students using Internet Explorer 9 without Flash installed were able to click
  disabled buttons and proceed through the verification process, though no
  photo was taken. Students now cannot proceed until they install Flash.
