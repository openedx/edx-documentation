* This release includes a redesigned user experience for publishing. 
  
  *  The process for creating, releasing, and updating content has been
     streamlined and simplified.

  *  Visual cues are now present on the **Course Outline** page and on
     individual unit pages to indicate whether your content is published and
     whether students can see it.

     time to immediately remove that unit from student view.

  Newsletter.

  response assessment problems.

* A new setting, **Enable video caching system**, is now available on the
  **Advanced Settings** page. When set to true (the default), HTML5 videos use
  video caching. (BLD-1207)

*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* When course discussions are closed, the **New Post** button is no longer
  included in discussion components. (FOR-108)

* When an incomplete course URL was entered in a browser, the error page that
  displayed included incorrect information. This defect has been corrected.
  (LMS-11189, LMS-11205)

**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce these upcoming changes, which will release in the
next few weeks:

* In addition to the existing Discussion post type, course discussions will
  soon include a new Question post type. Students and course teams will also be
  able to filter posts to find unanswered questions easily.

* A new user experience design for course discussions is coming! The new user
  interface controls will provide consistent methods for taking action on
  posts. A set of colorful badges will also make it easier to identify posts.

* A new bulk publishing feature will soon be available to enhance the changes
  that you see to the publishing workflow today. With bulk publishing, the
  process of releasing your course content to students will be significantly
  streamlined.
