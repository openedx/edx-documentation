The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of
October 7, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.


*******************************
edX Learning Management System
*******************************

* The private discussion cohorts feature has been released! When this optional
  feature is enabled for a course, the course team defines smaller communities
  of students within the larger, course-wide community. This feature allows
  course teams to divide students into cohort groups using either distinctive
  group characteristics or automated, random assignments. When the cohorts
  feature is enabled for a course, most discussion topics are divided so that
  students can only read and contribute to posts made by other members of the
  same cohort. However, course teams can create some open, or unified,
  discussion topics so that all students can read and contribute to that topic.
  Additionally, if the cohorts feature is enabled for the course, the CSV file
  that contains student profile data now includes a **Cohort** column.

  If you want to use the cohorts feature in your course, we strongly recommend
  that you implement the feature before your course is released. We do not
  recommend enabling cohorts in a running course.

  For more information, see Cohorts.

* In the Instructor Dashboard, downloading student profile data is now a
  background task. You can leave the **Data Download** page after you
  begin downloading students' profile information and return when the download
  is complete. Additionally, the **Download profile information as a CSV**
  button and the **List enrolled students' profile information** button have
  been moved to the **Reports** section of the **Data Download** page. (TNL-453)

* Course discussions have several new features:

  * Students can now change the topic of a post after they post it. Discussion
    administrators, moderators, and community TAs can edit the topic for any
    post.

  * Users no longer have the option to add comments to closed threads. (TNL-150)

  * When a user selects a topic for a post, a link to the unit that contains
    that discussion topic in the body of the course now appears immediately when the
    post is created. (TNL-404)

  * Users who have the discussion admin role can now remove their
    own or other users' discussion admin status. (TNL-315)

  * For some users, a list of posts did not appear in the left sidebar when
    the user clicked **Posts I'm Following**. This bug has been fixed. (TNL-469)

  * Pinned posts now always appear at the top of the list of posts, regardless
    of the way that the posts are sorted. (TNL-90)

* In some browsers, if a student clicked a word in a transcript to move to that
  point in the video, the video began playing from the correct point, but the
  transcript stopped following along with the video. This bug has been fixed.

* When a Problem component contained a custom JavaScript display and grading (JS
  Input) problem and at least one other problem, the JS Input problem was scored
  incorrectly. The additional problem in the component could be any type of
  problem. These problems are now scored correctly. (TNL-269)

* When you exported a course, the setting for **Video Download Allowed** in a
  Video component changed from **False** to **True** in the exported course.
  This bug has been fixed. (TNL-324)
