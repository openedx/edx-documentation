edX Studio

**************************
Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce the following upcoming change:

* Course teams will soon be able to access data about their courses on a
  dedicated dashboard for course-specific data. By providing insights into who
  your students are, and what they do while interacting with your course, the
  data available on this dashboard can validate choices youâ€™ve made, reveal
  unexpected patterns, and inform plans for changes to the course.
