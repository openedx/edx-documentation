The following information reflects what is new in the edX Platform as of
September 30, 2014. See previous pages in this document for a history of changes.

*******************************
edX Insights
*******************************

The initial version of edX Insights, our new course analytics product, is now
available. In this release, edX Insights provides data for student enrollment
activity, geographic location, and engagement with course content.

Team members who have the Admin or Staff role can open edX Insights
from the Instructor Dashboard. A banner announcing this new product displays at
the top of every page: click the **visit edX Insights** link to view data about
your course.

EdX Insights uses visualizations, key metrics, and tables to present data about
who your students are and what they do while interacting with your course. 

For example, the Weekly Student Engagement chart displays the number of
students who engaged in different activities over time.

         student activity of any kind, students who watched a video, and
         students who tried a problem.

To report where your students are, edX Insights shows a color-coded map.

         students than those with lighter shading.

You can use the data that is available from edX Insights to monitor activity,
validate choices, reveal unexpected patterns, form hypotheses, and inform plans
for your course. For information about edX Insights, see Using edX Insights.

Coming Soon
**************************

We're pleased to announce the following upcoming changes:

* EdX will soon release a fully supported cohorts feature that allows course
  teams and TAs to assign students to different cohorts in class discussions.
  Students in different cohorts will be able to see the discussions for their
  individual cohorts, but cannot see discussions for other cohorts. Course
  teams can also open some course discussions to all students.
