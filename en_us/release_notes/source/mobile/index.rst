The edX mobile app is now available for iPhone and Android smartphones. With
the app, learners can view or download video lectures for your courses and
watch them anytime, without an Internet connection. Many of the courses that
are currently running on edx.org are ready for use with the app, and
preparations to support mobile delivery are in progress for even more courses.

You and your enrolled learners can download the free edX mobile app from
Google Play for Android smartphones and from the App Store for Apple iPhones.
For answers to frequently asked questions about the mobile app, see `The
edX Mobile App`_ section in the *EdX Guide for Students*.
