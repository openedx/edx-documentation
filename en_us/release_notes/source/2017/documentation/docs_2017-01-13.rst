* The documentation for Custom JavaScript Display and Grading problems (also
  called custom JavaScript problems or JS input problems) has been extensively
  updated to reflect the new ``title`` attribute inside the ``jsinput`` tag, as
  well as the new problem template in Studio. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Custom JavaScript` in *Building and Running an edX
  Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Custom JavaScript` in *Building and Running
  an Open edX Course*.
