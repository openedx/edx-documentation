* The problem template for Custom JavaScript Display and Grading problems (also
  called custom JavaScript problems or JS input problems) has been updated.
  :jira:`TNL-5893`

* On unit pages in Studio, the guidance in the **Unit Location** panel now
  instructs course teams to use ``/jump_to_id/<location ID>`` formatting to
  create links to units in HTML text components.

  For example, to create a link to a unit that has a location ID of
  ``123456789abcdefghi`` in an HTML text component, you open the component,
  select the **Inset/edit link** icon, and then enter
  ``/jump_to_id/123456789abcdefghi`` in the **URL** field.
