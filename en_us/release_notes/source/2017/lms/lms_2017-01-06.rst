Two columns have been added to the Student Profile Report that course teams
generate on the **Data Download** page of the instructor dashboard. The
"enrollment mode" column indicates the enrollment track that the learner is
enrolled in, and the "verification status" column indicates whether learners who
are enrolled in tracks that require ID verification have successfully provided
ID verification. For more details about these columns, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Columns in the Student Profile Report`. (:JIRA:`TNL-6214`)
