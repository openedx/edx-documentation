When creating problems using XML, authors can now use HTML tags to add inline
markers that show additional information. Users see the additional text when
they hover their cursors over, or move keyboard focus to, markers in the problem
text. This feature includes enhanced support for screen reader users. (OSPR-353)

  changed to "Experiment Group." (TNL-1244)

* In the **Help** menu on the left side of the LMS, the X button to close the
  **Report a Problem** option did not work. This problem has been resolved.
  (TNL-1336)

* Students who enroll in the verified certificate track for a course, but do not
  verify their identity before the verification deadline, now receive a
  "Verification Deadline Has Passed" message in the browser when they try to
  verify their identity. Previously, students who missed the verification
  deadline saw a "Page Not Found" error message in the browser. (ECOM-1045)

* In courses that have cohort-specific content, the **Generate Grade Report** option on
  the **Data Download** tab of the Instructor Dashboard sometimes did not create
  a grade report. This problem has been resolved. (TNL-1351)

* In Safari, videos sometimes did not play at the selected speed. This problem
  has been resolved. (TNL-408)

* Course staff no longer have to obtain a course-specific anonymized student ID
  when they want to get student information in an open response assessment.

  get his information. (TNL-836)

Accessibility Improvements
============================

* Focus now changes directly to the content area after the user selects a link
  to a new subsection or unit. (UX-1573)

* Unit navigation links are reorganized into a single list. The arrow
  navigation is converted from links to buttons and now includes the disabled
  attribute when appropriate. (UX-1572)

* Labels to bypass blocks now use the industry standard text **Skip to main
  content**. (TNL-1264)

******************

* The first line of transcript files now appears for all videos. Previously,
  the first line did not appear if it contained a byte order mark. (TNL-935)

* Grade reports can now be generated successfully for all courses. Previously,
  an error caused grade reports to fail for courses with problem display names
  that contained Unicode characters. (TNL-1196)

  for the content experiment groups and cohorts to which students belong.

* When a pagination button is visually disabled, the button is now also
  disabled for screen readers. (TNL-997)

* When students checked their answers to a custom response problem with 10 or
  more inputs, the responses were not sorted correctly. This problem is
  resolved. (TNL-952)

* For numerical response problems, if the tolerance was set to greater than
  0.1, answers that varied from the correct answer by an amount equal to the
  tolerance were marked incorrect; that is, the correct answer was no
  inclusive of the tolerance setting. This problem is resolved. (TNL-904)

****************

****************

* In the Instructor Dashboard, when you unenrolled a student who enrolled in
  the Verified track, if that student was re-enrolled, he or she was
  automatically placed in the Verified track.  This problem is fixed; the
  student is no longer automatically enrolled in the Verified track. (ECOM-776)

* The Student Dashboard is updated to provide a visual indication of
  professional education courses the student is enrolled in. (ECOM-728)
