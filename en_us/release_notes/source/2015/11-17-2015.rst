 EdX is not issuing a platform release this week. Instead, edX has completed an
 upgrade of Django, the web framework that edX uses to develop Studio, the LMS,
 and Insights. This upgrade does not result in any user-visible changes.

The edX engineering wiki `Release Pages`_ provide access to detailed
information about every change made to the edx-platform GitHub repository. If
you are interested in additional information about every change in a release,
create a user account for the wiki and review the dated release pages.
