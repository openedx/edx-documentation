==============================
All Problem Parts Now Combined
==============================

Learner submissions for problems that have more than one part are now counted
only once, for the entire problem, rather than once for each part of the
problem. In courses that include problems with differing numbers of questions,
or parts, in each problem, the resulting graph could be difficult to interpret.

For example, a course has an assignment that includes some problems with four
parts, and other problems with only one part. The graph of the problem
submissions for the assignment before this change appeared as follows.

Now, with submissions for each problem counted once, the graph for the same
assignment in the course appears as follows.

PerÂ­ Problem Performance Data
=============================

EdX Insights now makes it easier to see how many learners did well on
assignments or on ungraded problems in course sections. In the performance
graphs for graded content and ungraded problems, the number of correct and
incorrect submissions received is now averaged by the number of problems.

Before this change was made, edX Insights presented totals rather than
averages. In courses that include differing numbers of problems in each
assignment, the resulting graph could be difficult to interpret.

For example, the first homework assignment in a course has four problems, the
second has six problems, the third has five problems, and so on. The graph of
the homework assignment submissions for the course before this change appeared
as follows.

Now, with the change to average submissions by the number of problems in each
assignment, the graph for the same course appears as follows.

Bug Fixes
============================

* Learners aged 26 years are now correctly included in the 26-40 age range.
  
* The Section Submissions report for Ungraded Problems now reports the number
  of problems in each section. Previously, the number of subsections in the
  section was reported in error.
