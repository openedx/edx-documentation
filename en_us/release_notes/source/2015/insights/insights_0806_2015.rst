A new metric that measures total interest in your course over time is now
available in edX Insights. The **Enrollment Activity** page now includes a
metric for **Total Enrollment** (the number of learners who have ever been
enrolled in the course) as well as for **Current Enrollment** (the number of
learners enrolled as of the computation date, not including learners who have
unenrolled).

For more information, see the :ref:`insights:Enrollment_Activity` section in
the *Using edX Insights* guide.
