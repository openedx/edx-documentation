Data for each of your course videos is now available in edX Insights. How many
learners started viewing the video, and how many actually completed it? What
parts of the video did learners replay, and what parts did they skip over? In
Insights, metrics and tool tips provide the exact counts, and a chart helps you
visualize your learners' viewing patterns for each five second segment.

For some videos, the information that you get from Insights might be a valuable
confirmation that your learners are engaged by the video content. For other
videos, the information might raise questions about why learners replay a
particular part of the video, or skip over a part of the video.

While you review data for a video in Insights, you can select **View Live** to
open the video component in the LMS. Using the viewing patterns revealed by
Insights, you can investigate specific segments of your course videos, and then
make deductions about causes and take action.
