Course enrollment data is now available only through edX Insights, which
reports both the current and total enrollment count for a course. Previously,
the Instructor Dashboard also reported the current enrollment count. This
change affects edx.org and edX Edge, not Open edX. For more information, see
:ref:`insights:Enrollment_Activity`.
