To improve accessibility, corrections were made to several of the edX website
pages. The changes correct the use of semantic elements, make labels
accessible, and order headings logically. Style changes across the platform
were also made to increase color contrast. (ECOM-1303, ECOM-1304, ECOM-1305,
UX-1949)
