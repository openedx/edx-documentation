As of the December 8 release, new courses on edx.org can offer two types of
certificate: verified and Xseries. Honor code certificates are no longer
available for new courses; instead, learners can audit courses without a fee.
In addition, learners who want to earn verified certificates have the option
of applying for financial assistance to help cover the cost of the verified
certificates.

If learners earned honor code certificates in earlier courses, they can still
access their certificates on their dashboards. For more information about
these changes to course certificates, see `Certificates Blog`_.
