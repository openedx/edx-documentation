Third Party Authentication with edX Edge
==========================================

To enhance sign in options and streamline access to courses running on the edX
Edge website, edX partner institutions can now enable third party
authentication between a campus or institutional authentication system and edX
Edge.

EdX uses the SAML 2.0 standard to exchange authentication and authorization
data, so this service is compatible with the Shibboleth single sign on system.
After you enable third party authentication and your institutional identity
provider, learners who already have campus credentials can use them to
authenticate into edX Edge.

For more information, see :ref:`installation:Enabling Third Party Authentication Edge` in *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open
edX Platform*.
