With the release of the latest version of the edX app for iPhones, learners who
access edX courses using iPhones will now have a more complete course
experience. They can now use the app to view HTML and text components, and
complete assignments that consist of the basic assessment types (checkbox,
dropdown, multiple choice, and text or numerical input).

For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD Mobile`.
