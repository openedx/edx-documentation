* Course enrollment data is now available only through edX Insights, which
  reports both the current and total enrollment count for a course. Previously,
  the Instructor Dashboard also reported the current enrollment count. This
  change affects edx.org and edX Edge, not Open edX.

* The following additional information is now available on the Course Info page
  on the Instructor Dashboard. 

  * Course Start Date, including the start time (UTC). 

  * Course End Date, including the end time (UTC). 
  
  * The number of sections included in the course. 
    
  Previously, this information was available only in Studio. (OSPR-733)
