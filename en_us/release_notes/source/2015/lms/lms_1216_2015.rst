* Support has ended for the "legacy" Instructor Dashboard. The LMS now
  presents a single version of the Instructor Dashboard. The **Revert to
  Legacy Dashboard** option is no longer available.

  The :ref:`installation:Feature Flag Index` in the *Installing, Configuring,
  and Running the edX Platform* guide is updated to reflect this change.

* To improve accessibility, the list of topics on the **Discussion** page of
  the LMS now uses colors that meet WCAG AA guidelines for contrast. As a
  result, the background color of the selected topic is now white instead of
  light blue.
