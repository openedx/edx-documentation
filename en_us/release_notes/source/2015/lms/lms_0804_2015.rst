Bug Fixes
====================================================

EdX has fixed the following bugs in the LMS.

* When a course team sent an email that contained a link for a course that was
  not yet live, learners received a 404 "Not found" error message when they
  selected the link in the email or followed another link to the course. Links
  to non-live courses now redirect to the student dashboard. (TNL-2693)

* Under **Basic Course Info** on the Instructor Dashboard, grade cutoffs were
  listed in the wrong order. For example, grade cutoffs appeared as follows.

  ``D: 0.6, B: 0.8, C: 0.7, A: 0.9``

  Grade cutoffs now appear in the correct order. (TNL-2848)

* A problem with the CourseOverview table prevented some mobile beta testers
  from seeing courseware. (MA-1063)

* When a learner earned partial credit on a problem, the score at the top of
  the problem was not rounded to the nearest 10. For example, the score might be
  ``0.666666666667/2 points``. (TNL-1857)
