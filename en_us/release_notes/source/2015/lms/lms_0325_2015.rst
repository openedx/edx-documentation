Cohort creation and management has moved from the **Advanced Settings** page
in Studio to the Instructor Dashboard in the LMS. Course teams can use the new
**Cohorts** tab there to add and rename cohorts, change a cohort's assignment
method, associate cohorts with content groups, and specify whether course-wide
and content-specific discussions are divided by cohort.
