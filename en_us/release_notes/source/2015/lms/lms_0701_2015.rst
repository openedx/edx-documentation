Changes to Common Problem Types
========================================

Two updates have been made to common problem types.

* Course teams can now add feedback, hints, or both to common problems.
* The appearance of these problem types has changed.

These updates apply to the following problem types.

* Checkbox
* Dropdown
* Multiple choice
* Numerical input
* Text input

Feedback and Hints in Common Problems
*********************************************

Learners might now see feedback, hints, or both, in common problem
types.

For example, when the course team configures one or more hints for a problem,
learners can view those hints by selecting **Hint** under the problem.

Problem Appearance Changes 
******************************

To make the edX LMS easier to use on mobile devices, the appearance of common
problem types has changed. For example, a border surrounds options for
multiple choice and checkbox problems, making it easier for learners to select
an option.
