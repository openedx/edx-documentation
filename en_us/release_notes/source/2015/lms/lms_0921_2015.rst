For a custom course on the Open edX platform, or CCX, instructors now receive
an error message if they use an invalid or unregistered email address to add a
user to a course. For more information about CCX, see
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Creating a Custom Course` in *Building and Running an
Open edX Course*.
