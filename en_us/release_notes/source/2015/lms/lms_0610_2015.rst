Report of Not-Yet-Enrolled Students 
====================================

Course teams for invitation-only courses can now track enrollment status from
the Instructor Dashboard. The **Data Download** page of the Instructor
Dashboard now includes a downloadable report of learners who have been invited
to enroll in a course, but who have not yet done so.

========================================
Learner Experience for Pre-Roll Videos
========================================

When a learner plays any course video in a course that includes a pre-roll
video, the pre-roll video plays first. Once the pre-roll video has been
presented to a learner, it is not shown to that learner again until seven days
have passed.

While the pre-roll video plays, the learner can select **Skip** to continue on
to the video that they selected, or **Do not show again** to permanently opt
out of seeing pre-roll videos in the course.

For information about how course teams can add a pre-roll video and its
transcripts to a course, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding a Pre-Roll Video` in *Building and Running an edX Course*.
