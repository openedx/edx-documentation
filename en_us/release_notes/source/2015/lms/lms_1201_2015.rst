Design Updates to the Video Player
===================================

This release includes several updates to the edX video player. These updates
are available to your learners immediately, and do not require you to make any
changes to your courses.

* The user interface controls for the player now appear only after a learner
  selects **play** for a video, and take up less screen space.

* New icon designs are now used for the **full screen** and **show transcript**
  options.

* The language menu, for video with transcript in multiple languages, is now
  indicated by a drop-down menu icon next to the **show transcript** icon.

* To improve accessibility, all options now use an icon font method that
  streamlines delivery.

* To enhance the experience of learners who use screen readers, changes that
  improve spoken announcements and simplify navigation are also included.

===================================
Gradebook Pagination
===================================

For courses with enrollments of up to 200 learners, course teams can review a
course gradebook on the Instructor Dashboard. Instead of presenting grades for
all enrolled learners on a single page, the gradebook now presents grades for a
maximum of 20 learners on each page. A pagination control is available to
access other pages in the gradebook.
