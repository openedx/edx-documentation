====================================================
Labelling of Roles in Studio and LMS Made Consistent
====================================================

The labels that identify two of the course team member roles in the LMS have
been renamed to match those same roles in Studio.

In the LMS, on the Instructor Dashboard **Membership** page, the "Course
Staff" role is now labeled "Staff", and the "Instructor" role is now labeled
"Admin". The "Staff" and "Admin" roles are the same, whether you assign them
in Studio by selecting **Settings** and then **Course Team**, or on the
Instructor Dashboard in the LMS.

No action is needed. No changes were made to the privileges granted by these
roles, or to the roles that Admins can assign in the LMS to beta testers,
discussion admins, discussion moderators, and community TAs.

=====================
Default Course Images
=====================

When courses do not have a course image specified, a default image is now used
in Course About pages in the LMS. (OSPR-621)

=====================
Student Dashboard
=====================

In the student dashboard, the **Find New Courses** button has moved
from the top of the page to the sidebar on the right side of the page.

===========================
Accessibility Enhancements
===========================

Keyboard navigation in open response assessments has been improved by
restoring keyboard focus outline indicators. (UX-2323)
