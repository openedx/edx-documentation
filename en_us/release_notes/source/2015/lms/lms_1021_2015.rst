For custom courses (CCX), if you add a CCX coach who is not currently enrolled
in the course, that user is now automatically enrolled in the course and sent
an email about the enrollment. For more information about CCX, see
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Creating a Custom Course`.

.. note:: Custom courses are currently supported only on Open edX.
