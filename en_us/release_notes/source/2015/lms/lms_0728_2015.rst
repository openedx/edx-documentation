Previewing the Course as a Specific Learner
====================================================

A new preview mode in the LMS allows course team members to see the courseware
as a specific learner would see it. In particular, for courses that use
randomized content from content libraries, course team members can view the
randomized content that was assigned to a specific learner and use this view to
adjust the learner's grades. Previewing the actual content that a learner was
assigned from a randomized content block is available only after the unit is
published, and after a learner has accessed the unit in the courseware.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Grades`
in *Building and Running an edX Course*.

====================================================
Icon Change for Graded Subsections
====================================================

The icon in the courseware contents next to a graded subsection has changed
from a clock to a paper and pencil symbol.
