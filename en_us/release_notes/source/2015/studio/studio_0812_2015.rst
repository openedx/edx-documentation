Bug Fixes
=============================================

Exporting a course failed when the filename for any asset was modified in XML
to contain forward or back slashes. This problem has been resolved. If a
course import or export is attempted and forward or back slashes are detected
in asset filenames, these characters are replaced with underscore characters,
in the same way as is done when slashes are detected in filenames of assets
when they are uploaded to Studio. (TNL-2669)

In problems with hints, MathJax did not display correctly in the hint text.
This problem has been resolved. (TNL-2857, TNL-298)
