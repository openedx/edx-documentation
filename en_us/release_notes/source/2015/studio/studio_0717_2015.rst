In Studio, problem types with hints and feedback are now listed at the bottom
of the list of common problem types. (TNL-2619)

==========================================================
Labelling of Roles in Studio and LMS Made Consistent
==========================================================

The labels that identify two of the course team member roles in the LMS have
been renamed to match those same roles in Studio.

In the LMS, on the Instructor Dashboard **Membership** page, the "Course
Staff" role is now labeled "Staff", and the "Instructor" role is now labeled
"Admin". The "Staff" and "Admin" roles are the same, whether you assign them
in Studio by selecting **Settings** and then **Course Team**, or on the
Instructor Dashboard in the LMS.

No action is needed. No changes were made to the privileges granted by these
roles, or to the roles that Admins can assign in the LMS to beta testers,
discussion admins, discussion moderators, and community TAs. For more
information about roles and privileges, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Course_Staffing` in the *Building and Running an edX
Course* guide.
