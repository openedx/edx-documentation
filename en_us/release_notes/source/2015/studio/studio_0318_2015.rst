* Course teams can now include a new type of component, a randomized content
  block, in their courses. These components randomly draw problems from a
  predefined library of components and present them to learners.

  You create and maintain libraries of components separately from courses. All
  of an organization's course teams can work collaboratively to develop the
  problems that the libraries contain. Each library can then be referenced by
  randomized content blocks in any of that organization's courses. For more
  information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Content Libraries`.

* Open response assessments can now include more than one prompt or question. A
  single rubric is used to grade all of the prompts in the assessment. For more
  information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Open Response Assessments`.

* When you add an HTML component to a course outline and select the Full
  Screen Image Tool, IFrame Tool, or Zooming Image Tool, revised example
  templates now appear. The descriptions and procedures in the
  templates now include additional detail, including how to provide 
  accessible labels for your learners.

* A problem with the file locking feature on the **Files & Uploads** page is
  now resolved. To lock a file, click the lock icon that appears near it.
