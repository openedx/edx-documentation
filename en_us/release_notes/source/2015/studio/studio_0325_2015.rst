Cohort creation and management has moved from the **Advanced Settings** page in
Studio. Course teams can now use the new **Cohorts** tab on the Instructor
Dashboard in the LMS to add and rename cohorts, change a cohort's assignment
method, associate cohorts with content groups, and specify whether course-wide
and content-specific discussions are divided by cohort.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Cohorts Overview`.
