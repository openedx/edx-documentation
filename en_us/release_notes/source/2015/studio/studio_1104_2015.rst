* This release includes the timed exams feature. Course teams can now configure
  a course subsection so that learners have a set amount of time to complete
  and submit all problems in that subsection.

  Course teams can grant individual learners more time to complete problems.

* On the **Course Team** page in Studio, the description has been updated to
  clarify that adding people to your course team does not automatically enroll
  them in your course. (TNL-3697)
