When course teams work in the course outline, they can now preview units in
the LMS before the content is released. When course teams select **Preview**
for a unit, they can choose to preview the unit in the LMS as staff, all
students, or as a student with access to a specific content group.

Previously, **Preview Changes** did not work until the content was live.

For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Preview Course Content`.
