* Course teams can now set due dates to any time, rather than only to times
  that end in HH:00 or HH:30. For example, course teams can now set due dates
  to 08:45 or 17:15.

* The **Tools** menu in Studio no longer offers the **Checklists** option. For
  a template checklist, see the :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Course Launch
  Checklist` topic in the *Building and Running an edX Course* guide or
  :ref:`opencoursestaff:Course Launch Checklist` topic in the *Building and
  Running an Open edX Course* guide.

* Several unused and deprecated items have been removed from the edX Platform,
  including the FoldIt protein simulator XModule and the first version of open
  response assessments (ORA 1). Courses that used ORA 1 continue to have access
  to associated data.
