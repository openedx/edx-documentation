=========================
New Office Mix Component
=========================

With `Office Mix`_, course teams can turn PowerPoint presentations into
interactive online lessons that are called mixes. This release includes the new
Office Mix tool, which you can use to embed mixes into your courses.

For more information about how you enable this tool and add mixes to a course,
see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Office Mix Tool` in *Building and Running an edX
Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Office Mix Tool` in *Building and Running an
Open edX Course*.

=========================================
Start Dates for Web Certificate Courses
=========================================

Course team members who have the Admin or Staff role can now set the start date
for a course that is configured to issue certificates before its certificates
are activated.

For more information about setting dates for a course, see
:ref:`partnercoursestaff:Set Start and End Dates` in *Building and Running an
edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:Set Start and End Dates` in *Building and
Running an Open edX Course*.

===================================
Transcripts for HTML5 Videos
===================================

This release corrects an error that prevented transcripts from being created
automatically for HTML5 (.mp4) video files. Now, when you add a video component
and then edit it later to identify the YouTube ID of a video file, two
different transcript files are created, one for YouTube and the other for
HTML5.
