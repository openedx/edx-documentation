Bug Fixes
===============

EdX has fixed the following bugs in Studio.

* Users received a "Page not found" error message when they selected **View
  Live** after adding a textbook in Studio. (TNL-1653)

* When a user deleted a unit in Studio, the unit remained in the LMS until the
  user re-published the subsection. (TNL-2593)

* Formatting errors occurred when users embedded MathJax in text input problems.

* If a course used the **Course Advertised Start Date** advanced setting,
  reruns of the course automatically used the previous advertised start date
  as the start date of the course. (PLAT-295)

====================
Problem Improvements
====================

EdX has made the following improvements to problem components in Studio.

* For drag and drop and custom JavaScript problems, edX has changed the default
  value of the **Show Answer** setting to **Never**. (TNL-645)

* Because options in checkbox problems are always formatted as a vertical
  list, edX has removed the ``direction`` attribute from the ``checkboxgroup``
  element. (TNL-231)
