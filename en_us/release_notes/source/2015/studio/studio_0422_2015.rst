* Course teams can now upload video transcripts for video components in either
  Simplified Chinese or Traditional Chinese. For more information, see
  :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video Components`.

* The **Advanced Settings** page for video components includes a renamed field,
  **Video ID**. Previously, this field was named **EdX Video ID**. For more
  information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Working with Video Components`.

* If course teams define either one or both of the **Video Start Time** and
  **Video Stop Time** values, learners no longer have the option to override
  those values and watch the entire video file. Only the segment of the video
  file that is delimited by your specified start and stop times plays.

  .. note:: The Video Start Time or Video Stop Time does not apply to videos
     that are downloaded or viewed using the native mobile app. Learners who
     use the mobile app can play the entire video file.

* A typographical error in the template filename for Math Expression Input
  problems has been corrected. ``Formularesponse.yaml`` is now correctly
  spelled. (TNL-1639)
