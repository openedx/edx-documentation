Spell Check for HTML Components
========================================

When you add an HTML component to a unit in your course, an automated spell
checker now indicates any misspelled words. The spell checker automatically
uses the dictionary that is set for your browser. (TNL-1621)

========================================
Support for Pre-Roll Video
========================================

Courses that run on edx.org can now include 5-10 second long pre-roll video
messages. A pre-roll video plays automatically before other course videos, and
can be used to advertise your organization, promote an XSeries, publicize an
event, and so on.

For information about adding a pre-roll video and its transcripts to your
course, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Adding a Pre-Roll Video` in *Building and Running an edX Course*.
