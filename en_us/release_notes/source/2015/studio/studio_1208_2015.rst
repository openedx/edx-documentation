==================
New LTI Component
==================

Course staff can now configure the way that learning tools interoperability
(LTI) components open when learners use them. You can configure LTI components
to open in a modal window, in a separate web browser window, or embedded in a
course page.

To use this new LTI functionality, you must enable the ``lti_consumer``
advanced module. This new advanced module replaces the ``lti`` module. The
``lti`` advanced module continues to work, but does not provide the new
options for launching behavior.

*Building and Running an edX Course* guide or :ref:`opencoursestaff:LTI
Component` in the *Building and Running an Open edX Course* guide.
