* If you include cohorts in your course, you can now assign different course
  content to different cohorts. See :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Cohorted Courseware Overview` for more details.  

* All courses created after 14 Jan 2015 now use the :ref:`key
  introspection API` format for internal course identifiers and the course URL.
  An example of the new URL format is:
  ``http://www.edx.org/courses/course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_2014/info``.

* MathJax, which Studio and the LMS use to render text as "beautiful math", is
  now upgraded to version 2.4 from version 2.2. For more information, see the
  descriptions of `MathJax 2.4`_ and `MathJax 2.3`_. (OSPR-21)

* When you create a new course in Studio, edit checks now identify special
  characters in the **Organization**, **Course Number**, or **Course Run**
  fields. An error message appears to prevent entry of spaces or characters
  such as ``!``, ``'``, ``(``, or ``)``. (SOL-233)

* For LTI components, you can now set the new **Accept grade past deadline**
  setting to True or False. The default for this setting is True. Previously,
  grading always included learner submissions that were submitted after the
  subsection due date. (TNL-805)
