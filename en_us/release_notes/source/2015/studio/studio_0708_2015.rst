New Poll and Survey Tools 
========================================

You can now include two new types of components in your courses.

* Use the Poll tool to pose a question to learners and have them select an
  answer from a set list. 

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Poll Tool` in the *Building and Running an edX
  Course* guide.

* Use the Survey tool to pose multiple questions to learners and have them
  select an answer for each question from a set list. 

  For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:Survey Tool` in the
  *Building and Running an edX Course* guide.

When you include polls and surveys in a course, you can analyze the responses
and also choose whether to let learners see the aggregate answers for the
class.

==================================
Original ORA Problems Deprecated
==================================

When you access a course that contains an open response assessment created
using the original version of this assignment type (ORA 1), Studio now
displays the message, "This course uses features that are no longer supported."

A newer version of the open response assessments feature (ORA 2) was released
over a year ago, and the ability to add ORA 1 problems was removed from Studio
in May 2014.
