Developers who are interested in extending Open edX Insights can now set up a
separate development environment, the Open edX Analytics Developer stack, to
support analytics development. This environment, known as the Analytics
Devstack, includes the edX Analytics Data API and Open edX Insights, as well
as all of the components needed to run the Open edX Analytics Pipeline.

For more information, see `Installing the Open edX Analytics Developer Stack`_
in the *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform* guide.
