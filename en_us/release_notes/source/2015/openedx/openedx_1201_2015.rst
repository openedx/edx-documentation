TPA Sign In Without Account Activation
=========================================

Learners who register and sign in to the edX site with valid campus or
institutional credentials, or with a Google or Facebook account, are no longer
prevented from signing in until after they activate their accounts. They are
now able to sign in and enroll in courses even before they follow the
activation link that is sent by email. A reminder message now appears on the
learner dashboard until account activation takes place.

A learner who enters an incorrect email address, and who therefore does not
receive the activation email message, can correct the email address by
selecting the menu next to his username, and then selecting **Account**.

=========================================
Command Change for SAML Testing
=========================================

The recent edX platform upgrade to Django 1.8 required a change to the
management command used when :ref:`installation:testing an enabled SAML
identity provider<Test an Enabled SAML Provider>`. This command now uses the
syntax ``lms saml --pull`` instead of ``lms saml pull``.

=========================================
Upgrade to Django 1.8.7
=========================================

As a follow up to the upgrade of the edX platform to Django 1.8.5, this release
upgrades the edX platform to Django 1.8.7.

For more information, see the Django release notes for `1.8.6`_ and `1.8.7`_.
