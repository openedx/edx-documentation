* On the dashboard for custom courses on the edX platform (CCX), the
  **Download student grades** option on the **Student Admin** pages caused the
  learner grade information to appear in the browser instead of creating a
  .csv file. This problem has been fixed.

* The configuration process for transmitting event data to Segment has been
  updated. You now add a single key:value pair to the ``lms.auth.json`` file,
  ``SEGMENT_KEY`` and your valid Segment API key. If you previously configured
  the ``SEGMENT_IO_LMS`` feature flag and the ``SEGMENT_IO_LMS_KEY`` key in
  the ``lms.auth.json`` file, you must replace these settings.
