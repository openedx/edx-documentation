=========================================
Initial Version of Comprehensive Theming
=========================================

This release introduces the initial version of comprehensive theming, which
gives sites that are running Open edX the ability to create and use themes to
change how their sites look.

Using the comprehensive theming system, Open edX site administrators can
change the default branding of the system to present their own brand. Logos,
page headers and footers, and other templates and assets that control the way
a site looks are now organized into specifically named directories and files
that can be replaced easily and without coding changes.

For more information, see :ref:`installation:Changing the Way Open edX Looks` in
the *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform* guide.
