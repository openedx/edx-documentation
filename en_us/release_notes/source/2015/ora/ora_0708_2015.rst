The original version of the open response assessment problem type, sometimes
referred to as ORA 1, has been deprecated. A newer version of open response
assessments, (ORA 2) was released over a year ago, and the ability to add ORA 1
assessments was removed from Studio in May 2014. This release includes the
following additional steps to discontinue use of the ORA 1 problem type.

* When you access a course that contains an ORA 1 assessment, Studio now
  displays the message, "This course uses features that are no longer
  supported."

* ORA 1 assessments no longer appear in the LMS.

For information about adding ORA 2 assessments to a course, see
