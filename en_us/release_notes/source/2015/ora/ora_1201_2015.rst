Open response assessments are enhanced in this release to allow course teams to
specify, and learners to submit, additional types of files along with their
text responses. To take advantage of this feature, when course teams edit an
open response assessment component in Studio to allow file uploads, the
following options are now available.

* Image files in .jpg, .gif, or .png format.

* The image file formats listed above, and also files in .pdf format.

* A custom set of one or more file formats, specified by the course team.

To protect learners from the transmission of potentially harmful files during
the peer assessment stage, this enhancement also gives system administrators
the ability to configure a list of file types that learners cannot upload.
