With the release of the Profiles feature, the information in course data
packages will change. The ``auth_userprofile`` table includes two new columns,
``bio`` and ``profile_image_uploaded_at``. Additionally, data packages will
include a new ``student_languageproficiency`` table. For more information, see
the :ref:`data:Student_Info` section in the *edX Research
Guide*.
