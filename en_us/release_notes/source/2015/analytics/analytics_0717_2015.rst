When a learner who was watching a video moved the video playhead forward in
the video playbar, the ``play_video`` event that was emitted contained the old
time of the play position, rather than the new time where the learner resumed
playing. This issue has been fixed. (TNL-2165)

For more information about video events, see :ref:`data:video` in the *EdX Research Guide*.
