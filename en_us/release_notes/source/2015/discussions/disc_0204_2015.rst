Accessibility Improvements 
============================

* The current discussion conversation now receives
  focus and includes an accessible label. (UX-1575)

* Discussions now include defined regions and landmarks for screen reader
  navigation. The focus is on the discussion when a new topic is loaded, and
  changes to a new post when it appears. (UX-1576)
