A new view, exposed within Studio, has been created to surface proctoring provider selection and settings related to proctoring. This also includes a drop down for selecting a proctored exam provider from a list of available providers."

By providing flexibility while also encouraging accountability, Personalized Learner Schedules help keep learners on track to complete their course."

msgid "**Mobile Log In & Registration**: A few updates to the iOS and Android registration experiences are important to call out with the aim of improving ease of use. Instead of scrolling and selecting a country now a user can write into the spinner view and this will filter accordingly. Input fields are now validated once a user's focus changes to the next field (previously the validation used to happen on the fly as the user typed into a field). A new API is now used to validate the registration prior to submission. Please see details in the `full API list`__."

msgid "**Username details Added to ORA Report Download**: In several moderation situations, course teams rely on the downloadable ORA report from the Data Downloads tab. We have added usernames to this report to help make triage of issues faster, as this report previously only included anonymous IDs. We have kept anonymous IDs in the report for now in case anyone has scripts that rely on the anonymous user ID."

msgid "**ORA Zipped File Download for Submission Text + Attached Files**: Some course teams have expressed an interest in downloading all ORA submissions, enabling instructors to print out and read student submissions offline. While future efforts will focus on an enhanced staff grading experience within the platform, some course teams still prefer to review offline or through printed student submissions. A course report in the data downloads tab of the instructor dashboard now includes a zipped folder that contains student ORA submissions and any attached files."

msgid "**Separate Assessment Steps & Schedule Authoring Areas**: To support improved authoring ease, we have added a new “Assessment Steps” tab to the ORA authoring experience, making it easier to see at a glance which steps you have enabled for your ORA problem. A new “Schedule” tab summarizes all the configured dates for the ORA problem, including the overall problem submission deadline if set, as well as the release dates for each of the ORA steps if those have been specified."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/koa.rst:86
msgid "**Grading Status Message**: Learners can now review a grading status message to understand their current grade as well as the way in which this was calculated. For example, ORA problem grades are determined by staff grading when this step is enabled, even if peer assessment is used elsewhere in the problem for feedback. Learners now see this explained in the final ORA problem section that shares final scores and feedback.  Additionally, this message explains for learners when their grade is still awaiting future peer responses or staff grading feedback, helping answer questions with fewer instructor interventions or direct support."

For those unfamiliar with LTI, this is a specification widely used to integrate different learning tools and platforms through well defined rules of communication and configuration. Open edX previously supported the LTI 1.1 / 1.2 specification, but we now also support the latest LTI 1.3 specification."

The current experience renders \"legacy\" v1 content libraries not powered by blockstore while also introducing basic support for v2 blockstore-backed video, problem and complex libraries. The new experience also provides improved search and filtering capabilities for the Library listing view. This work is in active development, and interested parties should reach out to the Open edX team to explore potential contributions and improvements to this experience."

Any theme for Paragon now has the ability to define a brand and a primary color to support more complex brand color schemes."
