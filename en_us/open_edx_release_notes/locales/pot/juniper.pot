Our previous release (Ironwood) was released in January 2019, so Juniper spans January 2019 through May 2020. You can also review details about `earlier releases`_ or learn more about the `Open edX Platform`_ if you are new to Open edX.

msgid "Many things have changed in our largest release yet, but a few key highlights include major core requirement upgrades to support Python 3 and Django 2. Additionally, a major shift toward micro-frontends and a component pattern library (Paragon) has led many platform areas to be marked for deprecation in favor of their future MFE replacements. On a related note, the deprecation process (DEPR project in Jira) has been a source of increased cleanup and visibility into keeping the platform healthy.  Also in the spirit of improved visibility and transparency, we have many new architecture decision records that locate platform decisions in context within the code. These serve as single repository versions of OEPs, and are also a key highlight for Juniper."
