msgid "We have replaced the back-end code (no UX changes) that generates course certificates with a new version to condense the number of conflicting generation logic patterns, make it easier to troubleshoot/support, and to better defend generated certificates against errant revocation."

msgid "By creating this new, unified course certificate generation logic we have improved certificate generation, revocation, allow-listing, program record synchronization, and issue resolution times."

msgid "To increase development speed and site performance, we've made improvements to the learning sequence experience (Learning MFE) on edX-platform, to use a React-based frontend that emulates the legacy experience.

msgid "After a year of diligently working to overhaul the learning sequence experience to use a React-based micro-frontend, it is now live for learners. This update to the underlying infrastructure of the learning sequence experience aims to drive innovation and experimentation that will ultimately foster greater learner engagement. With the new experience, learners will notice a reduction in load times and better site performance. However, the true beneficiaries of this work are internal development teams who will be able to quickly and efficiently build in this area of the system."

msgid "Using the React MFE allows for a richer learner experience by reducing course load-time and vastly improving the mobile-web experience. Additionally, the new experience supports learners by increasing internal development speeds which allows for greater feature development. By breaking down the courseware and reducing dependency, developers can more easily iterate in this area of the platform. Today, we see the benefits of this infrastructure change to the learning sequence experience contribute to the release of several projects and experiments."
