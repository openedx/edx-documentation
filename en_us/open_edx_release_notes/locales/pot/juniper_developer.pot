msgid "**Shared Frontend Platform Services:** In support of centralized configuration of baseline micro-frontend requirements, we have created the `Frontend Platform`_ repository. As part of this work various services (previously also described as \"runways\") were built to speed up configuration of analytics, logging, authentication, internationalization, as well as a set of other miscellaneous utilities and configuration details that affect all micro-frontends."

msgid "**MFE Template Application:** For new micro-frontends, you can start from the `Frontend Template Application`_ GitHub repository, a way to quickly spin up a new MFE using consistent tools and configuration details employed by other open edx platform MFEs. It is flagged as a template repository, meaning it can be used as a basis for new GitHub repositories via the \"Use this Template\" action."

#: ../../source/juniper_developer.rst:51
msgid "**MFE Service - Build:**  In order to standardize MFE configuration of styles, tests, and builds, a GitHub repository was created called `Frontend Build`_ to package as a single dev dependency. It aims to provide common sense defaults that should be good for most edX projects out of the box, but can be extended or overridden where needed."

This includes changes to reduce and mitigate unexpected upload failures, scaling the system to adequately handle increased loads, and reducing the need to re-encode videos unexpectedly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_developer.rst:134
msgid "**VEDA Deprecation Process:** After the performance and stability improvements, the team next set its sights on building a new Video Encoding Manager (VEM) which will utilize AWS and Media Convert as a replacement for the existing VEDA video pipeline. This is not available today but we are flagging for Juniper that VEDA is marked for deprecation, and our next release should include more details about its replacement - VEM."

Many areas of the platform have been updated to improve key requirements such as improved contrast and visibility, semantic page structure updates, as well as landmark container improvements that are all a part of the 2.1 specification."

Theming for Paragon works the same as themes for Bootstrap and any Bootstrap-compatible theme should be compatible with Paragon. This was done to help streamline the evolution of Paragon into a full-featured pattern library that supports all micro frontend applications and increasingly all areas of the platform. The effort to grow Paragon’s capabilities is ongoing."

While much of the work done for this effort was captured in JIRA as \":jira:`INCR-1`\", many other dependencies and related services were also updated to support Python 3. One example of these service upgrades was CodeJail, which is used to sandbox code written by course reams to assess or execute student problem submissions that rely on Python themselves."

A comprehensive plan for this work was `built and maintained in Confluence`__, and we have captured the team's `lessons learned from this project as well in Confluence`__. As we move forward we will continue to find ways to make it easy for the community to support distributed ownership of core platform health upgrades and maintenance so that we do not have to do major updates with the added  time pressure of end of life support dates."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_developer.rst:247
msgid "Towards this end, we've created various simple checks in `edx-repo-health`_. The checks answer questions like: Does the openedx.yaml file exist in repo? Is it parseable? Does Makefile have an upgrade target?"
msgstr ""

msgid "To run the checks, we've created the pytest plugin `pytest-repo-health`_. The plugin will find the checks in the specified directory and run them on the directory of your choice. The instructions to run the plugin can be found in its readme file. For now, data from individual repos is output as a yaml file. The aggregated data for many files is output as a csv."
