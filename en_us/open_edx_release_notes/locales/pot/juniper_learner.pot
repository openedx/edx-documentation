msgid "**Course Outline Depth:** For some time the course outline was shifted to rendering sections, subsections, and units. The resulting outline was long and provided detail that learners could navigate once in a subsection (aka learning sequence). The course outline has been updated to once again show only sections and subsections. As a part of this change we have made sure graded subsections show an icon to better highlight that they are graded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:24
msgid "**Graded Question Count:** The course outline now highlights the number of graded questions included in a subsection. The additional information added to the outline will allow learners to understand at-a-glance, and better plan for, the effort of a given graded assignment or exam."

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:33
msgid "**New Course MFE:** A major platform change for the learner experiences comes in the form of a new `micro-frontend application`__ to modernize the course learning experience. The primary Juniper focus of this application is an overhaul of the learning sequence experience, though we anticipate other views like Course Home will eventually also make their way into this new application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:41
msgid "**Content iFrames & Security:** This new micro-frontend is easier to update and configure than our previous experience, helping support lower development times and easier configuration and extension. The new experience uses iframes to render content into the application, as a side-effect does limit the ability to use Javascript on the page to interact with elements outside of the content frame, like the navigation or other areas of the page. The use of iframes here improves site security and code sandboxing, helping ensure stability for learners on the new application."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:50
msgid "**Course Home Clarity:** A home icon was also introduced to the breadcrumbs to reinforce the Course tab as the main home page for the course. Learners will still be able to click the top level course tab as well to get back to the Course Home."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:55
msgid "**Responsive Sequence Bar:** The learning sequence bar is now a bit smarter in how it responds to screen size and length of learning sequences. When learning sequences have too many items to properly render the icons and completion status, or when you are viewing the course on a mobile browser,  we replace the sequence bar with a dropdown that retains the unit type icon and completion status."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:62
msgid "**Next & Previous Action Clarity:** The next and previous buttons at the bottom of the page will be easier to spot and click, focusing on the “Next” action. Additionally, a message is shown to learners when they have reached the end of the course rather than show the next button at the bottom of the page."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:74
msgid "In the new course experience, visual completion is more obvious for learners with the elevated use of green checkmarks to convey progress. A recent completion logic change also reduced the time necessary to trigger completion on HTML only pages, an issue that was limiting some learners from being able to trigger completion rules."

msgid "Course Dates & Milestones"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:90
msgid "**Personalized Schedules:** Though self-paced courses offer the significant advantage of being available on-demand when a learner wants them, they lack the supporting structure of schedules and timelines. We’ve introduced some of this structure and accountability by creating personalized schedules for each learner, and clearly showing the suggested dates and timeline in the course. These schedules are based off of the course’s expected duration, and customized for each learner’s unique start date. We’ve also retained the advantages of flexibility --- should a learner fall behind, they are able to adjust their schedule."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/juniper_learner.rst:100
msgid "**Full Page Dates View:** To improve visibility into dates for both instructor-paced and self-paced courses, we have also introduced a dedicated full page view of critical course dates. Each relevant milestone will also link directly to the subsection, to provide easy and quick access. In the future, we will also add the ability for learners to add these dates to their calendars."

msgid "**Discussion Forum Daily Digests + Notifier Service:** We have marked this service as deprecated and disabled the discussion forum daily digest feature. We may revisit or reimplement this in the future but the experience was used by few learners, and the service that powered this capability was prone to instability and needed many upgrades to remain viable."

When learners select a beta (aka partially supported) language they are shown a message letting them know the language is partially translated. Additionally there are buttons to quickly switch back to their previous language or head to Transifex to join the open community that helps us translate the platform if they would like to contribute. Included below are visuals of the language dropdown as well as an example message shown for partially supported languages."
