Enabling the Bulk Email Feature
################################

This section describes a change to the process for enabling or disabling the
bulk email feature. This change was released to the edx-platform repository on
24 May 2016. On that date, the bulk email feature was disabled on all Open edX
installations. To re-enable the bulk email feature, you must follow the new
procedure described in this section.

**********************
About This Change
**********************

Prior to this change, you enabled or disabled the bulk email feature by making
manual updates to several files, including the ``lms/envs/common.py`` Python
file. The two relevant settings in the FEATURES section of this file were
``ENABLE_INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL`` and ``REQUIRE_COURSE_EMAIL_AUTH``.

.. important:: As of 21 May 2016, ``ENABLE_INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL: False`` is set for
  all Open edX sites that follow the edx-platform repository closely.

To simplify the process of changing the bulk email settings, a **Bulk_Email**
option is now available in the Django administration console.

*******************************
