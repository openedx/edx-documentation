 .. _Getting Started:

 *************************
 Getting Started
 *************************

 ======================================
 Do I need an edX account?
 ======================================

 You do not need an edX account to browse courses and view course details.
 However, you need to have an edX account before you can enroll in courses.

 You can register for an edX account in the edX app, or use a browser to
 go to the `edx.org`_ website. When you create your account, you need to be
 connected to the internet. For more information, see :ref:`Getting
 Started_account`.

 ======================================
 How do I create an edX account?
 ======================================

 Select **Register** in the edX app. You can create an edX account using
 your email address or a linked social media account.

 When you create an account, you are asked for the following information.

 * Your full name. This name is used on certificates that you earn.

   If you share a full profile, your full name is shown on your profile page on
   edx.org. For details, see :ref:`Adding Profile Information<SFD Profile Page>`.

 * The username that will identify you to course teams and to other learners.
 * A password.
 * The country or region that you live in.

 .. note:: When you register an account, you specify a username that will
    represent you on edX. Your username is used to identify you to course team
    members and other learners. You cannot change your public username after you
    register. EdX recommends that you select your username carefully.


 ===========================================
 How do I create or edit my user profile?
 ===========================================

 After you have created and activated your edX account, you can edit your user
 profile. Your edX profile allows you to share information about yourself with
 the edX community. Course teams and other learners in your courses can view
 your profile when they select your linked username in forums. You can share
 either a limited profile or a full profile.

 .. note:: You can change certain profile settings in the edX app, but be
    aware that the profile page on edx.org shows more information than the
    profile in the app shows.

    You must specify your birth year before you can share a full
    profile. If you are under 13 years of age, you cannot share a full
    profile or add a profile picture.

 In the edX app, follow these steps to view or edit your profile.

 #. From the main menu, select **Account**.

 All of the courses on edx.org are available on the edX app. However,
 depending on the type of problems used in the course, you might not be able
 to complete all the course assignments or exams using the app.

 To browse courses, select **Discover Courses** in the edX app, or select
 **Discover** from the app's main menu. You do not need to have an edX account
 or be logged in to browse courses. From the **My Courses** page in the app,
 you can also browse courses by tapping the search icon in the top corner.

 When you find a course that interests you, select the course to view its About
 page. The About page includes course details such as the course start date,
 the length of the course and effort required, whether a certificate is
 offered, the language that the course is taught in, and so on. Many About
 pages include a informational video about the course.

 For more information about edX courses and course availability, see
 :ref:`About Courses`.

 ==================================================
 How do I enroll in a course?
 ==================================================

 To enroll in a course, select **Enroll Now** from the course About page. You
 must log in or register on edx.org before you can enroll.

 When you initially enroll in a course, you join the audit track for a course.
 If the course includes a verified track and the upgrade deadline for the
 course has not passed, you can upgrade to the verified track to earn a
 certificate.

 For more information about enrolling and about course tracks, see :ref:`SFD
 Enrolling in a Course` and :ref:`Enrollment Tracks`

 The edX app does not yet support payment options such as upgrading to the
 :ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` for a course. To upgrade to the
 verified track for a course, sign in to edx.org and complete the payment on
 the website.

 .. note:: Courses for which you can earn verified certificates often require
    exams such as timed or proctored exams. While you can complete most of the
    course using the edX app, you cannot take these types of special exams
    using the app.

 ========================================
 How do I pursue a program?
 ========================================

 The edX app does not yet support upgrading to the verified track for all the
 courses in a program. To pay for upgrades to the verified track in a program,

.. _Assessment Questions:

========================================================
Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?
========================================================

The answer depends on the types of problems that are used in the course you are
taking. If a course contains mobile friendly problem types, you can complete
those types of problems using the mobile app. For a list of the types of
problems you can complete using the mobile app, see :ref:`What problems in
mobile app` You cannot take timed exams or proctored exams using the mobile app.

You can watch course videos on the mobile app, and can also download videos to
your mobile device for watching when you do not have an internet connection.
When you have an internet connection, you can also read course announcements,
participate in course discussions, and complete the mobile friendly problems
in your assignments.

.. note:: EdX recommends that you complete all of your graded assignments in a
   web browser on a computer. If your course includes timed exams or proctored
   exams, you cannot take them using the edX app.


.. _What problems in mobile app:

========================================================
What types of problems can I complete in the edX app?
========================================================

You can use the edX app to complete most of the problems in your assignments.
EdX courses can use a variety of problem types, and some courses might include
problem types that cannot be completed in the app.

For example, you can use the edX app to answer multiple choice questions, but
you cannot use it to draw molecules or design circuits. To complete problems
that require complex actions, you must use a web browser.

.. note:: EdX recommends that you complete all of your graded assignments in a
   web browser on a computer. If your course includes timed exams or proctored

course staff, usually organized based on course structure. Within each category,
you see lists of posts by learners. Each post has indicators to show the number
of comments and responses the post has received. The number of unread comments
for a post is shown until you have viewed a post.

.. Video Questions section is for both partners and Open edX

.. _Video Questions:

*************************
Video Questions
*************************

================================================
How much data do the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading
any video can result in heavy data use. EdX recommends using a Wi-Fi connection
if you intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX mobile apps have a
**Download only on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid
using your cellular network accidentally.

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, you must be connected to the internet. After you download
a video, you can watch it at any time.

#. In your course, navigate to the video or to the section of the course
   that contains the video you want to download. You can find videos in the
   course outline under **Course**, or find all the videos in the course under
   **Videos**.

#. Select the download icon for an individual video to download a single
   video, or the download icon for a subsection to download all the videos in
   that subsection.

   In a subsection, the number to the right of a subsection name indicates the
   number of videos in that subsection.

       :width: 200
       :alt: A list of subsections that contain videos, with one subsection

       :alt: A list of videos in a subsection, showing the download icon for a
         single video.

   When a video completes downloading the download icon changes to a check
   mark.


========================================
How do I change my download settings?
========================================

By default, the edX app is set so that it only downloads content, including
videos, if you are on a Wi-Fi network. If you change this setting, you might
exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.

#. From the main menu, select **Account**.

    .. image:: ../../shared/images/SFD_Mobile_Menu.png
       :width: 200
       :alt: The main menu of the edX mobile app, showing the My Courses,
         Discover, and Account options.

#. Select **Settings**.

#. Change the **Wi-Fi only download** setting.


========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape mode, or select "full
screen" in the bottom right corner of the video player.

    .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png
       :width: 300
       :alt: Video with "full screen" icon circled.


==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

Only the iOS version of the edX app supports changing the video playing speed.
While a video plays, select **Settings** (the "gear" icon) at the lower right of
the video player, and then select **Video Speed**.

On the Android version of the app, you cannot change the video playing speed.


===================================
How do I delete downloaded videos?
===================================

You can delete downloaded videos one by one or, if you have downloaded all the
videos in a course subsection, you can delete all of a subsection's videos at
once.

#. In your course, navigate to the downloaded video or to the subsection
   containing the videos you want to delete.

   You can only delete all the videos in a subsection if a checkmark icon
   appears for the subsection, indicating that you have downloaded all of the
   videos in that subsection.

#. Long press a downloaded video or a subsection of downloaded videos.

   The screen title changes to **Delete Videos**, and a trash can icon appears
   in the header bar.
