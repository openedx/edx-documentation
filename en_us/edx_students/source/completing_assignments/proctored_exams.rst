Proctored Exams
###############

Some courses require learners to pass at least one proctored exam. Proctored
exams typically differ from regular exams in the following ways.

* Proctored exams might have time limits.
* You might have to install proctoring software on your computer.
* You might have to verify your identity.
* You might have to scan your test environment with a webcam.
* The proctoring software might monitor your computer, including the programs
  that you have open, and record video and sounds during your exam.

Proctored Exam Technical Requirements
*************************************

Proctored exams might have specific technical requirements. Before you take a
proctored exam, read any requirements carefully. If you are not sure that your
computer meets the requirements, contact your instructor or support
organization.

************************
Practice Proctored Exams
************************

Your course might include an optional practice proctored exam. In a practice
exam, you set up the proctoring software on your computer and perform any
required identity checks and environment scans so that you know how to complete
these tasks for the actual exam. The practice exam usually includes several
example problems. This exam is not graded.

*********************************
Proctored Exam Rules for Learners
*********************************

The rules for each proctored exam depend on the proctoring service that your
course team or system administrator has chosen. However, the following rules
are common for "closed book" exams. The starting page for every proctored exam
includes a link to these rules.

The starting page also includes any additional rules that your instructor has
specified, such as allowing you to use a handheld calculator.
