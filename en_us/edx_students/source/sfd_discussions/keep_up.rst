.. _Read New or Updated Posts:

****************************
Reading New or Updated Posts
****************************

The list of posts in the discussion navigation pane on the **Discussion** page
provides visual cues to help you distinguish posts that are new, or that have
responses or comments that you have not read yet, from exchanges that you have
already read completely. For information about the labels and icons used in
posts, see :ref:`Discussion Navigation Pane`.

====================
Sorting by Activity
====================

In the discussion navigation pane you can sort posts by activity. To do this,
select the drop-down list of sorting options at the top of the discussion
navigation pane and select either **by recent activity** or **by most
activity**.

Sorting by recent activity changes the order of the posts so that the post that
was most recently updated appears at the top of the list. Updating includes
having responses or comments added.

Sorting by most activity changes the order of the posts so that posts with the
most responses or comments appear at the top of the list.


==================
Sorting by Likes
==================

In the discussion navigation pane you can sort posts by the number of likes
received. To do this, select the drop-down list of sorting options at the top
of the discussion navigation pane, and select by **Most Likes**.

Sorting by the most likes changes the order of the posts so that posts that
have received the most likes appear at the top of the list.

For more information about voting for posts, see :ref:`Like Posts or Responses`.

.. _Receiving Discussion Notifications:

*****************************
Receiving Notifications
*****************************

When you add a post to a discussion, you might receive an email notification
about the first reply to the post.

==============================
Receiving Email Notifications
==============================

.. only:: Open_edX

  If your course is set up to send email notifications for discussion posts,
  the first time another learner or member of the course team responds to a
  post that you have made, you receive an email notification.

.. Re: the above: It's technically the *platform* and not the course that would
.. be set up to send email notifications, but that won't matter to Open edX
.. learners and would be more complicated to explain.

.. only:: Partners

  By default, the first time another learner or member of the course team
  responds to a post that you have made, you receive an email notification.

You only receive an email notification for the first response.
