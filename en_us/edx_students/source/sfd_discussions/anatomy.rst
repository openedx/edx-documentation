.. _Basic Elements of Course Discussions:

******************************************************
Basic Elements: Topics, Posts, Responses, and Comments
******************************************************

The following example shows the different ways that you can contribute to a
discussion.

::

  Post: "Please introduce yourself."
    - Response: "My name is Lee and I teach secondary school maths in Canberra,
      Australia."
    - Response: "Hello everyone, I am Sumei from Hong Kong, China."
      - Comment: "Hi Sumei, I am taking this course in Hong Kong too. Maybe we
        should make a study group!"
      - Comment: "I'd like to join the Hong Kong study group too, I think it
        will help me keep up with the homework."
    - Response: "Hi from Johannesburg! I am taking the course to prepare for my
      matric exams."


A post initiates the conversation, responses are replies to a post, and
comments expand on specific responses. Before you add a post, response, or
comment to your course discussion, take a moment to consider which of these
options best suits the contribution that you want to make. This helps keep
course discussions organized and easy to follow.

Every post is associated with a topic, chosen from the list of topics created
by the course team. For information about topics, see :ref:`About Discussion
Topics`.

For more information about joining the discussions in your course, see
:ref:`Explore Posts` and :ref:`Add or Edit a Contribution`.


.. _About Discussion Topics:

====================================
Discussion Topics
====================================

Discussion topics are created by the course team and organize all posts in the
course discussion. Discussion topics can be course-wide or content-specific.

* Course-wide discussion topics cover matters that affect the entire course,
  and can include topics such as "Frequently Asked Questions" and
  "Troubleshooting". In the discussion navigation pane, course-wide topics do
  not have other topics indented below them.

* Content-specific discussion topics are added as part of a course unit, and
  relate to specific video lectures, reading assignments, homework problems,
  or other course content. In the discussion navigation pane on the
  **Discussion** page, content-specific topics are indented under an identifying
  category name.

For course-wide topics, you read or add posts, responses, and comments on the
**Discussion** page. For content-specific discussion topics, you can read or
add posts, responses, and comments both on the **Discussion** page and in the
discussion that is embedded in the course unit on the **Course** page.

Before you add a post, look through the topics. When you add your post to the
most appropriate topic, others with the same interest can find, read, and
respond to it more easily.

====================================
Types of Discussion Posts
====================================

When you make a contribution in a course discussion topic, you add your post
as either a question or a discussion.

* A question post raises an issue so that members of the discussion
  administration team and the course community can provide answers.

* A discussion post starts a conversation by sharing thoughts and reflections,
  and inviting community participation.

When you add a post to a discussion topic, you must specify whether it is a
question or a discussion.

On the **Discussion** page for your course, a question mark icon identifies
posts that ask questions and a conversation bubble icon identifies posts that
start discussions.

If you have any difficulty deciding which type of post you want to add, think
about whether you want to get concrete information (a question) or start an
open-ended conversation (a discussion). If you require an answer from the
course team, be sure to create your post as a question, so that the course
team sees that a response is required and responds appropriately.

********************
The Discussion page
********************

You browse and contribute to course discussions on the **Discussion** page for
your course. Discussions page is broadly divided into three areas, as seen below:

1. Navigation bar: For navigating forum content like threads, topics, learners, post creation etc.
2. Content view area: To view posts, responses and comments
3. Content list area: List of posts, learners, topics, search results etc.
