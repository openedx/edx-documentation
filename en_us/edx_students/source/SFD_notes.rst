******************
Overview of Notes
******************

As you work through an edX course, you may want to highlight a particular
passage or make a note about what you have read. In some edX courses, you can
highlight passages and make notes right in the course.

.. note:: You can create notes for most text in the body of the course.
 However, notes are currently not available for exercises, videos, or PDF
 textbooks.


When a course includes the notes feature, every page has a **Notes** page at
the top and a pencil icon in the lower right corner.

  :alt: Page of course content that includes the Notes page at the top,
      highlighted text with an accompanying note, and the pencil icon in the
      lower right corner.

Your notes can contain text as well as tags that help you organize and find
your notes. You can see individual notes inside the course content, or you can
see a list of your notes on the **Notes** page. For more information, see
:ref:`The Notes Page`.

.. _SFD SN Add Note:

******************************************
Highlight a Passage or Add a Note
******************************************

You can use either the mouse or keyboard shortcuts to create, access, and
delete notes. For more information about using keyboard shortcuts, see
:ref:`SFD SN Keyboard Shortcuts`.

To highlight a passage or add a note that includes text and tags, follow these
steps.

#. Select the text that you want to highlight or make the note about. You can
   select as much text as you want.

#. When a pencil "edit" icon appears above the selected text, select
   the icon to open the note editor.

         text.

#. When the note editor opens, enter your note and any tags that you want to
   add. You can also save the highlight for the passage without entering a
   note or tag.

  * To highlight a passage without adding a note or tag, select **Save** or
    press Enter. When you move your cursor over the highlighted text, the note
    field contains the words "no comment".

  * To enter a note, select **Comments**, and then type the text of your note.
    Your note can contain as many words as you want.

  * To add one or more tags, select **Add some tags here**, and then type any
    tags that you want to add.

    Tags cannot contain spaces. If you want to add a tag that has more than one
    word, type multiple words as one word with no spaces, or use hyphens (-)
    or underscores (_) to separate words in the tag.
