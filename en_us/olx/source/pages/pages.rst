You can add tabs, or pages, to your course. Each page appears in your course's
navigation bar.

Create the Tab File
*********************************************

You create an HTML file for each page you want to your course to offer in the
``tabs`` directory.

You can add any text and HTML markup to the page. Pages can also be links or
other types of content. One design pattern is to link a tab to a chromeless
XBlock in the courseware, which allows for top-level interactive course
content.
