This topic is planned to document features that the current symbolic response
supports. In general, it allows the input and validation of math expressions,
up to commutativity and some identities.

Features

This is a partial list of features, to be revised over time.

    * sub and superscripts: an expression following the ``^`` character
      indicates exponentiation. To use superscripts in variables, the syntax
      is ``b_x__d`` for the variable ``b`` with subscript ``x`` and super
      ``d``.

      An example of a problem.

      ::

        <symbolicresponse expect="a_b^c + b_x__d" size="30">
          <textline math="1"
           preprocessorClassName="SymbolicMathjaxPreprocessor"
           preprocessorSrc="/static/js/capa/symbolic_mathjax_preprocessor.js"/>
        </symbolicresponse>

      It's a bit of a pain to enter that.

    * The script-style math variant. What would be outputted in latex if you
      entered ``\mathcal{N}``. This is used in some variables.

      An example::

          <symbolicresponse expect="scriptN_B + x" size="30">
            <textline math="1"/>
          </symbolicresponse>

      There is no fancy preprocessing needed, but if you had superscripts or
      something, you would need to include that part.
