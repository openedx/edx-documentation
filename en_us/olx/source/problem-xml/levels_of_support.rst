 .. note:: The support level definitions described in this section and the
    level of support designated for each exercise, problem type, or tool are
    applicable only to edx.org.

The level of support that edX provides for each exercise, tool, or problem
type varies. The levels of support are categorized as full, provisional, or no
support. This table provides the definition for each level of support. In this
guide, each topic that describes each exercise, tool, or problem type contains
a note that indicates the edX level of support for that exercise, tool, or
problem type.

   * - Level of Support
     - Description
   * - Full support
     - Fully supported tools and features are available on edx.org, are fully
       tested, have user interfaces where applicable, and are documented in the
       official edX guides that are available on docs.edx.org.
   * - Provisional support
     - Provisionally supported tools and features are available on edx.org,
       but might lack the robustness of functionality that your courses
       require. Third party tools are classified as provisionally supported
       because edX does not have control over the quality of the software, or
       of the content that can be provided using such tools.

       You should test provisionally supported tools thoroughly
       before using them in your course, especially in graded sections.
       Complete documentation might not be available for provisionally
       supported tools, or documentation might be available from sources other
       than the official edX guides.
   * - Not supported
     - Exercises and tools with no support are not maintained by edX, and
       might be deprecated in the future. They are not recommended for use in
       courses due to non-compliance with one or more of the base
       requirements, such as testing, accessibility, internationalization, and
       documentation.
