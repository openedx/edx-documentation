The *edX Open Learning XML Guide* provides the information you need to build an
edX course through OLX (open learning XML) and supporting files, without using
edX Studio.  This document is an Alpha version. We will continue to make
significant updates to improve your ability to build XML-based courses.

This documentation is created using RST_ files and Sphinx_. You, the
user community, can help update and revise this documentation project on
GitHub::

  https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/docs/en_us/olx/source

To suggest a revision, fork the project, make changes in your fork, and submit
a pull request back to the original project: this is known as the `GitHub Flow`_.

All pull requests need approval from edX. For more information, contact edX at `docs@edx.org`_.
