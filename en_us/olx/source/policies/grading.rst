You create a grading policy file to specify how problems are graded in your
course.

*******************************
Create the Grading Policy File
*******************************

You define policies for your course in the ``grading_policy.json`` file.

Save the ``grading_policy.json`` file in the ``policy/<course-name>``
directory.

The ``<course-name>`` directory must match the value of the ``url_name``
attribute in the ``course.xml`` file.
