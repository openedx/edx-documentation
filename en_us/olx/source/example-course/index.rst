OLX (open learning XML) is a flexible system that you can use to create edX
courses in many ways. While there is no best way to structure courses in all
situations, there are best practices that help make an OLX course easier to
create and maintain.

This section uses the `edX-Insider`_ course as an example of how to create an
OLX course.  The files for `edX-Insider`_ are stored in GitHub, so you can
explore how the course is made for yourself.

These topics examine the overall structure of edX-Insider and how the
courseware is defined.
