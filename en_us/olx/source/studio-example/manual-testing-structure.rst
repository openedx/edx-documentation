  :depth: 1

For information about how a generic OLX (open learning XML) course is
structured, see
:ref:`OLX Directory Structure`.

For information about how a non-Studio OLX course can be structured, see
:ref:`The Structure of edX-Insider`.

.. note::
  The structure and content of the manual testing course can change without
  corresponding updates being made to this reference guide.

***************************************************************
Manual Testing Course and Directory File Structures
***************************************************************

All files and subdirectories that comprise the Manual Testing course are
stored in the `manual-testing-complete`_ directory in the edx-platform Git
repository.

.. Image:: ../Images/manual-testing-course-github.png
 :alt: The manual testing course in GitHub.

********************
Top-level Directory
********************

The `manual-testing-complete`_ directory in the edx-platform Git repository
contains the ``course.xml`` file as well as XBlock and Platform directories.

As a course exported for edX Studio, the ``course.xml`` file does not contain
the courseware content directly. All chapters, sequentials, verticals, and
XBlocks are defined in separate files and referenced from their parent files.

The ``course.xml`` file contains a single line that references the courseware
structure file in the ``course`` directory.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course url_name="2014" org="ManTestX" course="ManTest1"/>

The value of ``url_name``, ``2014``, matches the filename of the courseware
structure file, ``2014.xml``.

******************************
The Courseware Structure File
******************************

The courseware structure is defined in the `2014.xml`_ file in the ``course``
directory.

The ``2014.xml`` file specifies advanced settings as attributes of the
``course`` element, and lists the chapters (or sections) that make up the
courseware.

.. code-block:: xml

  <course advanced_modules="[&quot;annotatable&quot;,
    &quot;combinedopenended&quot;, &quot;peergrading&quot;, &quot;lti&quot;,
    &quot;word_cloud&quot;]" display_name="Manual Smoke Test Course 1"
    lti_passports="[&quot;ims:12345:secret&quot;]"
    pdf_textbooks="[{&quot;tab_title&quot;: &quot;An Example Paper&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;0An_Example_Paper&quot;, &quot;chapters&quot;:
    [{&quot;url&quot;: &quot;/static/1.pdf&quot;, &quot;title&quot;:
    &quot;Introduction &quot;}]}]" show_calculator="true" show_chat="true"
    start="2014-06-26T00:00:00Z">
      <chapter url_name="a64a6f63f75d430aa71e6ce113c5b4d2"/>
      <chapter url_name="d68c2861c10a4c9d92a679b4cfc0f924"/>
      <chapter url_name="ab97a6dbfafd48868c36bed4c8c5391d"/>
      <chapter url_name="5bb7a5ab824f460580a756a4f347377c"/>
      <chapter url_name="ce2fd991d84b4a5ca75350eb8e350627"/>
      <chapter url_name="be8a64868f2f460ea490e001a25e588d"/>
      <chapter url_name="3d216a50442f4cd5a1d4171c68f13f58"/>
      <chapter url_name="a0178ff300514e24829e239604dce12c"/>
      <chapter url_name="2df1fe87253549199f30cabb19e14b7c"/>
      <chapter url_name="60989ac1589241ed9dbca0f2070276fd"/>
      <wiki slug="ManTestX.ManTest1.2014"/>
  </course>

For each ``chapter`` element, the value of the ``url_name`` attribute matches
the name of the XML file in the ``chapter`` directory.  For example, the first
``chapter`` element's ``url_name`` attribute,
``a64a6f63f75d430aa71e6ce113c5b4d2``, matches
``a64a6f63f75d430aa71e6ce113c5b4d2.xml`` in the ``chapter`` directory.

Learners see the chapters that the ``course.xml`` file defines in the LMS on
the **Course** page in the course navigation pane.

.. Image:: ../Images/courseware-chapters.png
 :alt: Chapters in the learner's courseware.

**************
Chapter Files
**************

The structure of each chapter, or section, in the courseware is defined in the
XML file in the ``chapter`` directory.

Each chapter file specifies the sequentials, or subsections, in the chapter.
An example follows.

.. code-block:: xml

  <chapter display_name="New Section 1 - Annotatable">
    <sequential url_name="d7d631967807476485aa26ba0c39a992"/>
    <sequential url_name="f09502cf408742c2aa3c92705ab1dce7"/>
    <sequential url_name="0e86943b2cb54a56a1a14c13da3f388d"/>
    <sequential url_name="948737f132254c2aa65f6024edee7e68"/>
    <sequential url_name="f9372e3b199a4986a46c8d18e094b931"/>
    <sequential url_name="d912a92ed03d4f818661a1636b8a6f9b"/>
  </chapter>

For each ``sequential`` element, the value of the ``url_name`` attribute
matches the name of the XML file in the ``sequential`` directory.  For example,
the first ``sequential`` element's ``url_name`` attribute,
``7d631967807476485aa26ba0c39a992``, matches
``7d631967807476485aa26ba0c39a992.xml`` in the ``sequential`` directory.

Learners see the sequentials that the chapter file defines in the LMS on the
**Course** page in the course navigation pane.

.. Image:: ../Images/courseware-sequentials.png
 :alt: Sequentials in the learner's courseware.

*****************
Sequential Files
*****************

The structure of each sequential, or subsection, in the courseware is defined
in the XML file in the ``sequential`` directory.

Each sequential file specifies the verticals, or units, in the subsection.
An example follows.

.. code-block:: xml

  <sequential display_name="New Subsection 10.4">
    <vertical url_name="e81c7ddcf5434387a2a6163ca973520c"/>
  </sequential>

For each ``vertical`` element, the value of the ``url_name`` attribute
matches the name of the XML file in the ``vertical`` directory.  For example,
the ``vertical`` element's ``url_name`` attribute,
``e81c7ddcf5434387a2a6163ca973520c``, matches
``e81c7ddcf5434387a2a6163ca973520c.xml`` in the ``vertical`` directory.

Learners see the verticals that the sequential file defines in the LMS on the
**Course** page in the unit navigation bar. The following example shows a
sequential with one vertical, which has one XBlock.

.. Image:: ../Images/courseware-vertical.png
 :alt: A vertical in the learner's courseware.

*****************
Vertical Files
*****************

The structure of each vertical, or unit, in the courseware is defined
in the XML file in the ``vertical`` directory.

Each vertical file specifies the XBlocks, or components, in the unit.
For example, the following vertical contains one problem:

.. code-block:: xml

  <vertical display_name="checkbox ">
    <problem url_name="a473cecce312487a8339995bde24be53"/>
  </vertical>

Each ``vertical`` element contains a child element for each XBlock in the
vertical.

Learners see the XBlocks that the vertical file defines in the LMS.

For each XBlock, the value of the ``url_name`` attribute matches the name of
the XML file in the XBlock directory.  The XBlock directory name is specific to
the type of XBlock and matches the XML element name. The following XBlock types
are included in the `Manual Testing`_ course.

* ``annotable``
* ``combineopenended``
* ``html``
* ``lti``
* ``problem``
* ``video``
* ``word_cloud``

********************
Other XBlock Files
********************

XBlock files contain the actual content learners engage with in the learning
management system.

The root element of an XBlock file is the type of XBlock, as well as the parent
directory name.  For example, the root element of files in the ``html``
directory is ``html``.

An example of a problem XBlock follows.

.. code-block:: xml

  <problem display_name="Blank Common Problem" markdown="Capital of France is
    Paris:&#10;&#10;[[false, (true)]]&#10;">
    <p>Capital of France is Paris:</p>
    <optionresponse>
      <optioninput options="('false','true')" correct="true"/>
    </optionresponse>
  </problem>

Learners see the problem in the vertical (or unit) page as follows.

.. Image:: ../Images/courseware-blank-problem.png
 :alt: A vertical in the learner's courseware.

********************
Platform Directories
********************

The `Manual Testing`_ course includes platform directories to support
non-courseware parts of the OLX course. For more information, see
:ref:`edX Platform Directories`.
