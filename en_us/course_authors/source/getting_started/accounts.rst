Getting Started with edX

The following topics provide an introduction to edX and instructions for
getting started on edX websites.

This information is intended for course teams. The *EdX Learner's Guide* also
includes information about creating an account and the edX Demo course. You
might want to share course- or institution-specific details about the
registration process, such as password policies or the use of campus
credentials, in your communications with prospective students.

For information about enrolling students in a course, see
:ref:`enroll_student`.

.. _edX.org and edX Edge:

*************************
edx.org and edX Edge
*************************

To explore edX courses, you can register an account on the edx.org_ website,
the `edX Edge`_ website, or both. These sites are visually and functionally
similar, but their content and purposes are different.

* edx.org hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs) from edX institutional
  partners. To publish a course on edx.org, you must have an agreement with edX
  and specific approval from your organization. Courses on edx.org are publicly
  listed in the edX course catalog and are open to learners from around the
  world.

* Edge, at edge.edx.org, is a more private site. Courses on Edge are not
  published on edx.org. Any member of a partner course team can create and
  publish courses, including test courses, on Edge without receiving approval
  from edX or a partner institution.

  However, Edge does not have a course catalog, and courses cannot be found
  through search engines such as Google. Only learners whom you explicitly
  invite or who have the URL for your course can participate in your course on
  Edge. Note that you can invite an unlimited number of learners to participate
  in an Edge course.

  EdX Edge also hosts small private online courses (SPOCs).

.. note:: 
 All course data and user accounts on Edge and edx.org are separate. If you
 want to use both edx.org and Edge, you must complete the account registration
 process on both sites.

.. _Create an Account:

*************************
Create an Account
*************************

Before you create, or register, your account, note the following.

* If you are at an edX partner institution, be sure to supply your
  institutional email address or select an existing account (such as a campus
  account) that is set up to use your institutional email address.

* Learners and other course team members will see the name that you enter as
  your public username, not your full name. You cannot change your public
  username after you register.

To register an account on the edx.org or edX Edge website, go to the `edx.org
registration`_ or `Edge registration`_ page, and then follow these steps.

Note that you can only access the account settings page from the LMS, and not
from Studio.

.. _edX101_section:

******************************
The edX Demo Course and edX101
******************************

EdX provides the edX Demo course and Overview of Creating an edX Course 
to help familiarize you with taking and creating edX courses.

* The `edX Demo course`_ allows new students to explore and learn how to take
  an edX course. We recommend that you become familiar with the way students
  experience an edX course before you begin building your first course.

  .. note::
    You can include information about the edX Demo course in your course
    materials, and recommend that new learners take the edX Demo course before
    proceeding with your course.

* `Overview of Creating an edX Course`_ is an example of a course built with
  Studio. It is a self-paced walk-through of planning, building, and running
  your own online course.
