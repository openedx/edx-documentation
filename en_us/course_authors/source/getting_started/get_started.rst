If your organization has an agreement with edX and approval to do so, you can
run courses on the edX Edge and edx.org websites.

If you are using an instance of Open edX to create a course, see
:ref:`opencoursestaff:Getting Started with Studio` in the *Building and Running
an Open edX Course* guide.

.. _What is Studio?:

***************
What is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses. You use Studio to create
a course structure, and then add problems, videos, and other resources for
learners. You can also manage the course schedule, identify members of the
course team, set the grading policy, publish your course, and more.

* For the edX Edge site, anyone who has approval to use Studio can create and
  develop courses.

* For the edx.org site, only edX staff members can create courses in Studio.
  Course teams at partner institutions can then use Studio to develop the
  courses. Contact your partner manager to discuss your schedule and other
  requirements.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.
