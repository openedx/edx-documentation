What is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses. 

You use Studio to create course content, problems, videos, and other resources
for students.

With Studio, you can also manage your schedule and course team, set grading
policies, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.


.. _Use Studio on Edge:

******************
Use Studio on Edge
******************

You also use Studio on Edge to build your own courses.

Go to: https://studio.edge.edx.org. Sign in with the account you created on
Edge.

You must then request access to create courses.

#. Select the **+** icon to expand the field labeled **Becoming a Course
   Creator in Studio**.

#. Select **Request the Ability to Create Courses**.

EdX evaluates your request. When course creation permissions are granted,
you are notified by email.

.. _Studio: https://studio.edge.edx.org
.. _Edge: http://edge.edx.org

When you receive notice that you can create courses, log in to Studio_.

You see the following page, which is your **My Courses** dashboard:

 :alt: The Studio home page where you create your first course

#. Select **Create Your First Course**.
#. Enter course information as applicable and select **Create**.

   :alt: The Create New Course page

  .. note::  
    Enter new course information carefully. This information becomes part of
    the URL for your course. To change the URL after the course is created, you
    must contact edX through the Help site (http://help.edge.edx.org).
    Additionally, because this information becomes part of your course URL, the
    total number of characters in the following three fields must be 65 or
    fewer.

  * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name
    might be “Sets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the
    course title.

  * For **Organization**, enter the name of your organization. Do not include
    whitespace or special characters.

  * For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For
    example, for public health course number 207, enter **PH207**. For math
    course 101x, enter **Math101x**. Do not include whitespace or special
    characters in the course number.

    .. note:: 
      If your course will be open to the world, be sure to include the "x". If
      it is exclusively an on-campus offering, do not include the "x".*

3. Select **Save**.

Your new course opens to the **Course Outline** page. Because you have not yet
created any content, this page is empty.

In your browser’s address bar, notice that the URL of your course includes the
course organization, number, and course run.

You can now view your empty course on Edge.
  
.. _View Your Course on Edge:
    
************************
View Your Course on Edge
************************

You can now view the course you just created, even though it does not contain
any content.

In the Course Outline in Studio, select **View Live**. The course opens on
Edge.

You can also go directly to Edge_. Log in if prompted. You see the course you
just created listed on your **My Courses** dashboard:

.. image:: ../../../shared/building_and_running_chapters/Images/new_course.png
 :width: 600
 :alt: The Edge Dashboard

You can view the course and see that there is no content yet.

.. _Register Your Course on edx.org:

************************************
View Your Course on edX.org
************************************

If your organization has an agreement with edX and approval to do so, you can
create a course on edX. To see the content of your course as students will see
it, you must enroll in your course. You can then view it on the LMS.

#. In Studio, create your course and add content.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select the blue **View
   Live** button in the upper right corner of the page.

   Your course enrollment page opens in a new tab on the LMS.

#. Select the blue **Enroll** button to enroll in your course. After you enroll
   in your course, it opens in the LMS.

#. To continue working on your course, in your browser, switch back to the tab
   that shows Studio. You will still be on the **Course Outline** page.
