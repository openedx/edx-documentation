What is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses. 

You use Studio to create course content, problems, videos, and other resources
for students.

With Studio, you can also manage your schedule and course team, set grading
policies, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.

.. _Use Studio on Edge:

******************
Use Studio on Edge

You also use Studio on Edge to build your own courses.

Go to: https://studio.edge.edx.org. Sign in with the account you created on
Edge.

You must then request access to create courses.

#. Select the **+** icon to expand the field labeled **Becoming a Course
   Creator in Studio**.

#. Select **Request the Ability to Create Courses**.

EdX evaluates your request. When course creation permissions are granted,
you are notified by email.

If your organization has an agreement with edX and approval to do so, you can
create a course on edX. To see the content of your course as students will see
it, you must enroll in your course. You can then view it on the LMS.

#. In Studio, create your course and add content.

#. On the **Course Outline** page, select the blue **View
   Live** button in the upper right corner of the page.

   Your course enrollment page opens in a new tab on the LMS.

#. Select the blue **Enroll** button to enroll in your course. After you enroll
   in your course, it opens in the LMS.

#. To continue working on your course, in your browser, switch back to the tab
   that shows Studio. You will still be on the **Course Outline** page.
