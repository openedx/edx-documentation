Managing Course Discussions
##################################

Discussions, or discussion forums, foster interaction among your students and
between students and course staff. You can set up different topics to guide
these interactions when you create your course, and then run and moderate
discussions throughout the course to encourage participation and develop course
community.

Discussions are also excellent sources of feedback and ideas for the future.

For options you can use to run and moderate discussions, see the following
sections:

* :ref:`Overview_discussions`

* :ref:`Organizing_discussions`

* :ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`

* :ref:`Running_discussions`

* :ref:`Moderating_discussions`

* :ref:`Close_discussions`
  
For information about how enabling the cohort feature for a course affects
options for moderating course discussions, see :ref:`Moderating Discussions for
Cohorts`.

.. _Overview_discussions:

********************************
Overview
********************************

Students and staff use course discussions to share ideas, exchange views,
consider different viewpoints, and ask questions. In a discussion, there are
three hierarchical levels of interaction.

* A *post* is the first level of interaction. A post opens a new subject. Posts
  are often posed as questions, either to start a conversation or to surface an
  issue that requires some action. When you add a post, you categorize it as a **Question** or as a **Discussion**.  

* A *response* is the second level of interaction. A response is a reply made
  directly to a post to provide a solution or continue the conversation.

* A *comment* is the third level of interaction. A comment is often a
  clarification or side note made to a specific response, rather than to the
  post as a whole.
 
The dialogue created by a post, its responses, and the comments on those
responses is sometimes called a thread.

All course staff members and enrolled students can add posts, responses, and
comments, and view all of the posts, responses, and comments made by other
course participants. Members of the course community, both staff and students,
can be given permission to moderate or administer course discussions through a
set of discussion administration roles. Discussion threads are saved as part of
the course history.

.. note:: 
  The :ref:`Discussions for Students and Staff` chapter describes features that
  are available to all discussion participants, and may be useful to students
  who are new to online discussion forums. You can share the chapter with your
  students by, for example, adding a "Never Used a Discussion Forum Before?"
  post that includes the information you think will be most useful to them.

.. _Organizing_discussions:

*************************************************
Creating Discussion Topics for Your Course
*************************************************

Discussions in an edX course include both broad topics on course-wide areas of
interest such as "Feedback", "Troubleshooting", or "Technical Help", and the
content-specific topics that you add to course units as discussion components.
You create both types of discussion topics in Studio.

For details about creating discussion topics, see :ref:`Create CourseWide
Discussion Topics` and :ref:`Create ContentSpecific Discussion Topics`.
For details about configuring discussion topics in courses with cohorts enabled, see :ref:`Set up Discussions in Cohorted Courses`.

.. _Create CourseWide Discussion Topics:

=====================================
Create Course-Wide Discussion Topics
=====================================

All courses include a page named **Discussion**. When you create a course, a
discussion topic named "General" is available for you to include by default.
You can add more course-wide discussion topics to guide how students share and
find information during your course. Such course-wide topics might include
Feedback, Troubleshooting, or Technical Help. Discussions in these topics can
begin as soon as your course is available.

To create a course-wide discussion topic:

#. Open your course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. Scroll down to the **Discussion Topic Mapping** policy key. By default, its
   value is:

 .. image:: ../Images/Discussion_Add_initial.png
  :alt: Policy value of {"General": {"id": "i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course"}}

4. Copy the three lines provided for the General topic and paste
   them above the closing brace character (``}``):

 .. image:: ../Images/Discussion_Add_paste.png
  :alt: Policy value of {"General": {"id": "i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course"} 
        "General": {"id": "i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course"}}

5. Replace the second "General" with the quoted name of your new topic.

#. Change the value for the second "id" to a unique identifier. For example,
   append a reference to the name of the topic.

#. Add a comma after the first closing brace (``},``).

 .. image:: ../Images/Discussion_Add_name.png
  :alt: Policy value of {"General": {"id": "i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course"}, 
        "Course Q&A": {"id": "i4x-edX-Open-edx_demo_course_faq"}}

8. Click **Save Changes**. Studio resequences and reformats your entry. Scroll
   back to the **Discussion Topic Mapping** field to verify that your entry was
   saved as you expect. Entries that do not contain all of the required
   punctuation characters revert to the previous value when you save, and no
   warning is presented.

When students click the **Discussion** page for your course, the drop-down
Discussion list now includes the topic you added.

 .. image:: ../Images/NewCategory_Discussion.png
  :alt: Image of a new topic named Course Q&A in the list of discussions

.. note:: In courses with cohorts enabled, the course-wide discussion topics
   that you add are unified. All of the posts can be read and responded to by
   every student, regardless of their assignement to a cohort. You have the
   option to configure these topics to be divided by cohort. See :ref:`Identifying
   Private CourseWide Discussion Topics`.

.. _Create ContentSpecific Discussion Topics:

============================================
Create Content-Specific Discussion Topics
============================================

To create a content-specific discussion topic, you add a discussion component to
a unit. Typically, you do this while you are designing and creating your
course in Studio. Follow the instructions in :ref:`Working with Discussion
Components`. The result is a discussion topic associated with a unit and its
content.

A content-specific discussion topic is subject to the release date of the
section that contains it. Students cannot contribute to a content-specific
discussion topic until the containing section has been released.

.. note:: In courses with cohorts enabled, all content-specific discussion
   topics are divided by cohort when you first add them. Student posts to divided
   discussion topics can only be read and responded to by members of the same
   cohort. You can change the configuration of content-specific discussion topics
   to make them unified and available to all students in the course. See
   :ref:`Configure ContentSpecific Discussion Topics`.

.. _Assigning_discussion_roles:

*************************************************
Assign Discussion Administration Roles 
*************************************************

You can designate a team of people to help you run course discussions.

.. note:: 
  The course team that you set up in Studio (or the course staff and
  instructors you add on the Instructor Dashboard) are not automatically
  granted discussion administration roles. Discussion administration roles must
  be explicitly granted to members of the course team for them to moderate or
  administer course discussions. The course author, team members with Admin
  access (Studio), and Instructors (Instructor Dashboard) can grant discussion
  administration roles.

Different options for working with discussions are available through
these roles:

* *Discussion moderators* can edit and delete messages at any level, review
  messages flagged for misuse, close and reopen posts, pin posts, and endorse
  responses. Posts made by moderators are marked as "By: Staff" in the list of
  posts. Responses and comments made by moderators have a colored "Staff"
  identifier. This role is often given to course team members who already have
  the Course Staff role.

.. removed this clause from 1st sentence per JAAkana and MHoeber: , and, if the
.. course is cohorted, see posts from all cohorts

* *Discussion community TAs* have the same options for working with discussions
  as moderators. Posts made by community TAs are marked as "By: Community TA"
  in the list of posts on the **Discussion** page. Responses and comments made
  by community TAs have a colored "Community TA" identifier. This role is often
  given to students.

.. I put this comment in to make the formatting of this bulleted list consistent when output using the sphinx template

* *Discussion admins* have the same options for working with discussions as
  moderators, and their posts, responses, and comments have the same "Staff"
  identifiers. This role can be reserved for assignment to course team members
  who have the Instructor role only: the discussion admins can then both
  moderate discussions and give other users these discussion management roles
  whenever necessary.

Before you can assign roles to your discussion team, you need their email
addresses or usernames.

* To get this information for a course team member, on the Instructor Dashboard
  click **Membership** and then select **Course Staff** or **Instructor** from
  the drop-down list.

* To get this information for an enrolled student, on the Instructor Dashboard
  click **Data Download**, then **Download profile information as a CSV**.

====================================
Assign Roles
====================================

To assign a discussion administration role, you must be the course author or an
Instructor (that is, you are identified in Studio as a team member with Admin
access).

#. View the live version of the course.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**.

#. In the Administration List Management section, use the drop-down list to
   select Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators, or Discussion Community
   TAs.

#. Under the list of users who currently have that role, enter an email address
   or username and click **Add** for the role type.

#. To remove an assigned role, view the list of users and then click **Revoke
   access**.

.. _Running_discussions:

*********************
Run a Discussion
*********************

On an ongoing basis, the members of your discussion team run the course
discussion by making contributions, endorsing responses, marking answers as
correct, and guiding student messages into pertinent threads. Techniques that
you can use throughout your course to make discussions successful follow.

==========================================
Use Conventions in Discussion Subjects
==========================================

To identify certain types of messages and make them easier to find, you can
define a set of standard tags to include in the subject of a post or in the
body of a response or comment. Examples follow.

* Use "[OFFICIAL]" at the start of announcements about changes to the course.

* Provide information about corrected errors with a subject that begins
  "[ERRATA]".

* Direct students to use "[STAFF]" in the subject of each post that needs the
  attention of a course staff member.

Both your discussion team and your students can use tags like these to search
the discussions more effectively.

When a post is created its type must be selected: either "question" or
"discussion". Members of the discussion team should be thoughtful when
selecting the type for their posts, and encourage students to do the same. See
:ref:`Find Question Posts and Discussion Posts`.

.. future: changing the type of a post, maybe resequence or separate  conventions from post types

========================
Seed Discussion Topics
========================

To help students learn how to get the most out of course discussions, and find
the best discussion topic to use for their questions and conversations, you can
seed discussion topics by adding posts before your course starts. Some examples
follow.

* In the General topic (which is included in every course by default), add an
  [INTRO] post to initiate a thread for student and staff introductions.

* For each topic that you create, add the first post to it to describe
  the way you intend it to be used. In addition to providing guidance, these
  initial messages can also act as models for students to follow when they
  create their own posts.

* If you include discussion components along with problem components in a unit,
  you can add a post that encourages students to use the topic to ask for help
  with the problems, but reminds them not to post the answers.

======================================
Minimize Thread Proliferation
======================================

To encourage longer, threaded discussions rather than many similar, separate
posts, the discussion team can use these techniques. However, be aware that
long threads (with more than 200 responses and comments) can be difficult to
read, and can therefore result in an unsatisfactory experience in the
discussion.

* Pin a post. Pinning a post makes it appear at the top of the list of posts on
  the **Discussion** page. As a result, it is more likely that students will
  see and respond to pinned posts. You can write your own post and then pin it,
  or pin a post by any author. Select the "More" icon and then **Pin**.

    .. image:: ../Images/Pin_Discussion.png
     :alt: Image of the pin icon for discussion posts

* Endorse a response. Endorsing a response indicates that it provides value to
  the discussion. Click the "check mark" (or tick mark) icon for the response.

    .. image:: ../Images/Endorse_Discussion.png
     :alt: Image of the Endorse button for discussion posts

* Mark a question as answered. You use the same procedure to mark a response as
  the correct answer to a question as you do to endorse contributions to a
  discussion: click the "check mark" (or tick mark) icon for correct answers.

* Close a post. You can respond to a redundant post by (optionally) pasting in
  a link to the post that you prefer students to contribute to, and prevent
  further interaction by closing the post. Select the "More" icon and then
  **Close** to close it.

* Provide post/response/comment guidelines. You can post information from the
  :ref:`overview<Overview_discussions>` in this chapter, or the :ref:`anatomy
  of edX discussions<Anatomy of edX Course Discussions>` in the next chapter,
  in a course-wide discussion topic (such as General) to provide guidance about
  when to start a new thread by adding a post, responding to an existing post,
  or commenting on a response.

.. _Moderating_discussions:

***********************
Moderate Discussions
***********************

The members of a course discussion team monitor discussions and keep them
productive. They can also collect information, such as areas of particular
confusion or interest, and relay it to the course staff.

Developing and sustaining a positive discussion culture requires that
sufficient moderator time is dedicated to reviewing and responding to
discussions. Keeping up-to-date with a large MOOC forum requires a commitment
of 5 or more hours per week, and involves reading threads, replying to and
editing posts, and communicating with the rest of the discussion team and
course staff.

For information on setting up moderators for your course, see
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`.

========================================
Provide Guidelines for Students
========================================

You can develop a set of best practices for discussion participation and make
them available to students as a course handout file or on a defined page in
your course. These guidelines can define your expectations and optionally
introduce features of edX discussions.

You can also share the :ref:`Discussions for Students and Staff` chapter with
your students. It describes features that are available to all discussion
participants, and may be useful to students who are new to online discussion
forums.

.. For a template that you can use to develop your own guidelines, see
.. :ref:`Discussion Forum Guidelines`.

========================================
Develop a Positive Discussion Culture
========================================

Discussion monitors can cultivate qualities in their own discussion
interactions to make their influence positive and their time productive.

* Encourage quality contributions: thank students whose posts have a positive
  impact and who answer questions.

* Check links, images, and videos in addition to the text of each message. Edit
  offensive or inappropriate posts quickly, and explain why.

* Review posts with a large number of votes and recognize "star posters"
  publicly and regularly.

* Stay on topic yourself: before responding to a post, be sure to read it
  completely.

* Maintain a positive attitude. Acknowledge problems and errors without
  assigning blame.

* Provide timely responses. More time needs to be scheduled for answering
  discussion questions when deadlines for homework, quizzes, and other
  milestones approach.

* Discourage redundancy: before responding to a post, search for similar posts.
  Make your response to the most pertinent or active post and then copy its URL
  and use it to respond to the redundant threads.

* Publicize issues raised in the discussions: add questions and their answers
  to an FAQ topic, or announce them on the Course Info page.

For a template that you can use to develop guidelines for your course
moderators, see :ref:`Guidance for Discussion Moderators`.

.. _Find Question Posts and Discussion Posts:

==========================================
Find Questions and Discussions
==========================================

When students create posts, they specify the type of post to indicate whether
they are asking for concrete information (a question) or starting an open-ended
conversation (a discussion). 

On the **Discussion** page, a question mark image identifies posts that ask
questions, and a conversation bubble image identifies posts that start
discussions. When an answer is provided and marked as correct for a question, a
check or tick mark image replaces the question mark image. See :ref:`Answer
Questions`.

In addition to these visual cues, filters can help you find questions and
discussions that need review. Above the list of posts on the **Discussion**
page, the **Show all** filter is selected by default. You can also select:

* **Unread**, to list only the discussions and questions that you have not yet
  viewed.

* **Unanswered**, to list only questions that do not yet have any responses
  marked as answers.

==================
Edit Messages
==================

Discussion moderators, community TAs, and admins can edit the content of posts,
responses, and comments. Messages that include spoilers or solutions, or that
contain inappropriate or off-topic material, should be edited quickly to remove
text, images, or links.

#. Log in to the site and then select the course on your **Current Courses**
   dashboard.

#. Open the **Discussion** page and then open the post with the content that
   requires editing. You can select a single topic from the drop-down list of
   discussion topics, apply a filter, or search to locate the post.

#. For the post or for the response or comment that you want to edit, click the
   "More" icon and then **Edit**.

#. Remove the problematic portion of the message, or replace it with standard
   text such as "[REMOVED BY MODERATOR]".

#. Communicate the reason for your change. For example, "Posting a solution
   violates the honor code."

==================
Delete Messages 
==================

Discussion moderators, community TAs, and discussion admins can delete the
content of posts, responses, and comments. Posts that include spam or abusive
language may need to be deleted, rather than edited.

#. Log in to the site and then select the course on your **Current Courses**
   dashboard.

#. Open the **Discussion** page and then open the post with the content that
   requires deletion. You can select a single topic from the drop-down list of
   discussion topics, apply a filter, or search to locate the post.

#. For the post or for the response or comment that you want to delete, click
   the "More" icon and then **Delete**.

#. Click **OK** to confirm the deletion.

.. how to communicate with the poster?

.. important:: If a message is threatening or indicates serious harmful 
 intent, contact campus security at your institution. Report the incident
 before taking any other action.

==================================
Respond to Reports of Misuse
==================================

Students have the option to report contributions that they find inappropriate.
Moderators, community TAs, and admins can check for messages that have been
flagged in this way and edit or delete them as needed.

#. View the live version of your course and click **Discussion** at the top of
   the page.

#. In the list of posts on the left side of the page, use the filter drop-down
   list (set to **Show all** by default) to select **Flagged**.

#. Review listed posts. A post is listed if it or any of its responses or
   comments has been reported. The reported contribution includes a
   **Reported** identifier.

#. Edit or delete the post, response, or comment. Alternatively, remove the
   flag: click the "More" icon and then **Unreport**.

===============
Block Users
===============

For a student who continues to misuse the course discussions, you can unenroll
the student from the course. See :ref:`unenroll_student`. If the enrollment
period for the course is over, the student cannot re-enroll.

.. _Close_discussions:

******************************
Close Discussions
******************************

You can close the discussions for your course so that students cannot add
messages. Course discussions can be closed temporarily, such as during an exam
period, or permanently, such as when a course ends.

When you close the discussions for a course, all of the discussion topics in
course units and all of the course-wide topics are affected.

* Existing discussion contributions remain available for review.
  
* Students cannot add posts, respond to posts, or comment on responses.
  However, students can continue to vote on existing threads, follow threads,
  or report messages for misuse.

* Course Staff, Instructors, Discussion Admins, Discussion Moderators,
  and Discussion Community TAs are not affected when you close the discussions
  for a course. Users with these roles can continue to add to discussions. 

.. note:: To make sure your students understand why they cannot add to 
  discussions, you can add the dates that discussions are closed to the
  **Course Info** page and post them to a General discussion.

=====================================
Start-End Date Format Specification
=====================================

To close course discussions, you supply a start date and time and an end date
and time in Studio. You enter the values in this format:

``["YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM", "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM"]``

where:

* The dates and times that you enter are in the Universal Coordinated (UTC)
  time zone, not in your local time zone.

* You enter an actual letter **T** between the numeric date and time values. 

* The first date and time indicate when you want course discussions to close.

* The second date and time indicate when you want course discussions to reopen.

* If you do not want the discussions to reopen, enter a date that is far in the
  future.

* Quotation marks enclose each date-time value.

* A comma and a space separate the start date-time from the end date-time.

* Square brackets enclose the start-end value pair.

* You can supply more than one complete start and end value pair. A comma and a
  space separate each pair.

For example, to close course discussions temporarily for a final exam period in
July, and then permanently on 9 August 2014, you enter:

``["2014-07-22T08:00", "2014-07-25T18:00"], ["2014-08-09T00:00", "2099-08-09T00:00"]``

You enter these values between an additional pair of square brackets which are
supplied for you in Studio.

============================================
Define When Discussions Are Closed
============================================

To define when discussions are closed to new contributions and when they
reopen:

#. Open your course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. Scroll down to the **Discussion Blackout Dates** policy key. 

#. In the field for the value, place your cursor between the supplied square
   brackets. Use the required date format specification to enter the start and
   end dates for each time period during which you want discussions to be
   closed.

   When you enter the dates and times from the example above, the value field
   looks like this:

   .. image:: ../Images/Discussion_blackout_unformatted.png
     :alt: Policy value of [["2014-07-22T08:00", "2014-07-25T18:00"],
         ["2014-08-09T00:00", "2099-08-09T00:00"]]

5. Click **Save Changes**.

   Studio reformats your entry to add line feeds and indentation, like this:

   .. image:: ../Images/Discussion_blackout_formatted.png
     :alt: Same policy value but with a line feed after each bracket and comma,
         and an indent before each date

For examples of email messages that you can send to let students know when the
course discussions are closed (or open), see :ref:`Example Messages to
Students`.
