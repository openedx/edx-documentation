.. _Enabling and Configuring Cohorts:


############################################
Enabling and Configuring the Cohorts Feature
############################################

To support cohorts in your course, you select a strategy for assigning your
students to cohort groups: automated assignment, manual assignment, or a hybrid
approach. See :ref:`Options for Assigning Students to Cohorts`. You also decide
whether course-wide or content-specific discussion topics should be divided by
cohort or unified for all students.

After you select a strategy, you complete these configuration steps (as
applicable):

#. :ref:`Enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>`.

#. Based on the strategy you select for assigning students to cohort groups:
   
  * :ref:`Define the auto cohort groups<Define Auto Cohort Groups>`.
  * :ref:`Define the manual cohort groups<Define the Manual Cohort Groups>` and
    then :ref:`assign students<Assign Students to Cohort Groups
    Manually>` to them.
  * Do both. 

#. Identify the discussion topics that you want to be divided by cohort. If you
  want :ref:`course-wide discussion topics to be divided by cohort<Identifying
  Private CourseWide Discussion Topics>`, you need to perform some configuration
  tasks. In contrast, for content-specific discussion topics, you need to perform
  some configuration tasks only if you do not want these discussion topics to be
  divided by cohort.

You complete these procedures in Studio and on the Instructor Dashboard. For an
optimal student experience, configuration of the cohort feature should be as
complete as possible prior to the start date of your course. 

If you need to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature
while your course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Enable Cohorts:

********************************
Enabling the Cohort Feature
********************************

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor between the
   supplied pair of braces.

#. Type ``"cohorted": true``. 

#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio reformats the name:value pair you just
   entered to indent it on a new line.

        as true

You can then :ref:`implement the automated assignment strategy<Implementing the
Automated Assignment Strategy>`, :ref:`implement the manual assignment
strategy<Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy>`, or both.

.. _Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement automated assignment of students to cohort groups you define the
auto cohort groups in the **Cohort Configuration** advanced setting field.

You complete this procedure if you are using either the automated or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All
Automated Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

.. _Define Auto Cohort Groups:

============================================
Define the Auto Cohort Groups
============================================

Before you define your auto cohort groups, note that students can see the name
of the cohort group they are assigned to. The message "This post is visible
only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that are
divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohort groups or change their names. If you need 
 to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature while your course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor after the opening
   brace character (``{``) and press Enter.

#. On the new line, you define the ``"auto_cohort_groups":`` policy key,
   followed by one or more cohort group names enclosed by square brackets (``[
   ]``). You can define a set of auto cohort groups or just one.

   To define a set of groups, you type each group name on a new line, enclose
   it within quotation marks (``" "``), and separate the quoted name values
   with commas. For example:
   
 .. code:: 

   "auto_cohort_groups": [
       "Example Group Name A",
       "Example Group Name B",
       "Example Group Name C"
   ]
   
.. comment is here only to allow indented formatting of next line

  You can also define only a single auto cohort group. Type
   ``"auto_cohort_groups": ["Example Group Name"]`` and then press Enter again.

5. Type a comma after the closing square bracket character (``],``). You must
   include a comma to separate each of the policy keys that you define.
   
#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio resequences and reformats your entry. Scroll
   back to the **Cohort Configuration** field to verify that your entry was
   saved as you expect. Entries that do not contain all of the required
   punctuation characters revert to the previous value when you save, and no
   warning is presented.

        with one value

Any student who is not already assigned to a cohort group will be randomly
assigned to one of the auto cohort groups when she visits any of the course
discussion topics.

For a report that includes the cohort group assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.

.. _Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement manual assignment of students to cohort groups, you define the
manual cohort groups and then assign students to them. 

You complete these procedures if you are using either the manual or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All Manual
Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

You must :ref:`enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>` for your course
before you can complete these procedures.


.. _Define the Manual Cohort Groups:

==========================================
Define the Manual Cohort Groups
==========================================

Before you define your manual cohort groups, note that students can see the
name of the cohort group they are assigned to. The message "This post is
visible only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that
are divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohort groups or change their names. If you need 
 to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature while your
 course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Click **Add Cohort Group**.

#. Supply a name for the group, and then click **Save** below the **New Cohort
   Name** field.

.. _Assign Students to Cohort Groups Manually:

==========================================
Assign Students to Cohort Groups Manually
==========================================

.. note:: Manual assignments should be as complete as possible before your 
 course starts. If student enrollment continues after your course starts, you
 should continue to assign new students to cohort groups. 

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Select a cohort group from the drop down list.

#. In the **Add students** field, enter the username or email address of a
   single student, or enter multiple names or addresses separated by commas or
   new lines. You can copy data from a CSV file of email addresses and paste it
   into this field.

#. Click **Add Students**. The students are assigned to the selected manual
   cohort group. A message appears to indicate the number of students who were
   added to the cohort group. Because students can belong to only one cohort
   group, the message also indicates the number of students whose assignment to
   another cohort group was changed by this procedure.

For a report that includes the cohort group assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.


.. _Altering Cohort Configuration:

*****************************************************************
Altering Cohort Configuration in a Running Course
*****************************************************************

The configuration of the cohort feature should be complete and stable before
your course begins. Manual cohort assignments should be completed as soon as
possible after any student enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while
your course is running. 

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and activity in the course discussion begins, be sure that you understand the
consequences of these actions:

* :ref:`Changing a student's cohort group assignment<Changing Student Cohort
  Group Assignments>`

* :ref:`Renaming a cohort group<Renaming a Cohort Group>`

* :ref:`Deleting a cohort group<Deleting a Cohort Group>`

* :ref:`Disabling the cohort feature<Disable the Cohort Feature>`

.. _Changing Student Cohort Group Assignments:

=============================================
Change Student Cohort Group Assignments
=============================================

After your course starts and students begin to contribute to the course
discussion, each post that they add is visible either to everyone or to the
members of a single cohort group. When you change the cohort group that a
student is assigned to, there are three results:

* The student continues to see the posts that are visible to everyone.

* The student sees the posts that are visible to his new cohort group.

* The student no longer sees the posts that are visible only to his original
  cohort group.

The visibility of a post and its responses and comments does not change, even
if the cohort group assignment of its author changes. To a student, it can
seem that posts have "disappeared".

To verify the cohort group assignments for your students, download the 
:ref:`student profile report<View and download student data>` for your course. 
If changes are needed, you can :ref:`assign students<Assign Students to Cohort 
Groups Manually>` to different cohort groups manually on the **Membership** 
page of the Instructor Dashboard.

.. _Renaming a Cohort Group:

==========================
Rename a Cohort Group
==========================

Name changes for cohort groups are not supported. The **Membership** page of
the Instructor Dashboard does not offer an option to rename your manual cohort
groups.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, changing the names in the
listed name:value pairs **does not** result in any renamed auto cohort groups.
Instead, changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these
results.

* The system uses the new value that you saved for the ``auto_cohort_groups``
  policy key to create one or more additional auto cohort groups.

* The system begins to assign students who do not have a cohort group
  assignment to the newly defined cohort group or groups. Students also
  continue to be assigned to any auto cohort groups that were not affected by
  your changes.

  The system uniformly distributes students among all of the auto cohort groups
  that exist when an assignment is needed. The size of each group is not
  considered.

* The original cohort group or groups remain in the system. Any students who
  were assigned to the original groups remain assigned to them.

  For the results of assigning any students who remain in the original cohort
  groups to other groups, see :ref:`Changing Student Cohort Group Assignments`.

* The system converts the original auto cohort groups, which are no longer
  listed as values for ``auto_cohort_groups``, into manual cohort groups. The
  system no longer assigns students to those groups automatically. These cohort
  groups are listed as manual cohort groups on the **Membership** page of the
  Instructor Dashboard.

.. _Deleting a Cohort Group:

==========================
Delete a Cohort Group
==========================

Deletion of cohort groups is not supported. The **Membership** page of
the Instructor Dashboard does not offer an option to delete your manual cohort
groups.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, removing any of the listed
name:value pairs **does not** result in the deletion of any cohort groups.
Instead, changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these
results.

* The cohort groups that you removed from the policy key remain in the system.

* Any students who were assigned to those groups remain assigned to them. 
  
  For the results of assigning any students to other groups, see :ref:`Changing
  Student Cohort Group Assignments`.

* The system no longer assigns students to the groups automatically. 

* The groups are listed as manual cohort groups on the **Membership** page of
  the Instructor Dashboard, and you can continue to assign students to them
  manually.

.. _Disable the Cohort Feature:

==============================
Disable the Cohort Feature
==============================

You can disable the cohort feature for your course. Follow the instructions for
:ref:`enabling the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>`, but set ``"cohorted":
false``. All discussion posts immediately become visible to all students.

If you do reenable the cohort feature by setting ``"cohorted": true``, all
previous student cohort assignments are reenabled, and all visibility settings
for posts are reapplied. However, any posts created while the cohort feature
was disabled will remain visible to all users.
