.. _Enabling and Configuring Cohorts:

############################################
Enabling and Configuring the Cohorts Feature
############################################

To support cohorts in your course, you select a strategy for assigning your
students to cohorts: automated assignment, manual assignment, or a hybrid
approach. See :ref:`Options for Assigning Students to Cohorts`. You also decide
whether course-wide and content-specific discussion topics should be divided by
cohort or unified for all students.

After you select a strategy, you complete these configuration steps (as
applicable):

#. :ref:`Enable cohorts<Enable Cohorts>`.

#. Determine the method you want to use to assign students to cohorts:
   
  * :ref:`Define automatic cohorts<Define Auto Cohorts>`

  * :ref:`Define manual cohorts<Define Manual Cohorts>` and
    :ref:`manually assign students<Assign Students to Cohorts Manually>`
    to them

  * :ref:`Use a combination of automated and manual assignment<Hybrid
    Assignment>`.

3. Optionally, identify the discussion topics that you want to be divided by
   cohort.
   
  * If you want :ref:`course-wide discussion topics to be divided by
    cohort<Identifying Private CourseWide Discussion Topics>`, you need to complete
    some configuration tasks.

  * In contrast, if you want content-specific discussion topics to be divided
    by cohort, you do not need to take any action. Instead, you need to complete
    some configuration tasks only if you want :ref:`content-specific discussion
    topics to be unified<Make ContentSpecific Discussion Topics Unified>`.

You complete these procedures in Studio and on the Instructor Dashboard. For an
optimal student experience, you should make sure that configuration of the
cohort feature is as complete as possible prior to the start date of your
course.

If you need to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature
while your course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.


.. _Enable Cohorts:

***************************
Enabling the Cohort Feature
***************************

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor between the
   supplied pair of braces.

#. Type ``"cohorted": true``. 

#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio reformats the name:value pair you just
   entered to indent it on a new line.

        as true

You can then :ref:`implement the automated assignment strategy<Implementing the
Automated Assignment Strategy>`, :ref:`implement the manual assignment
strategy<Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy>`, or both.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.


.. _Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement automated assignment of students to cohorts, you define auto
cohorts in the **Cohort Configuration** advanced setting field.

You complete this procedure if you are using either the automated or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All
Automated Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

.. _Define Auto Cohorts:

=======================
Define Auto Cohorts
=======================

Before you define your auto cohorts, note that students can see the name of the
cohort that they are assigned to. The message "This post is visible only to
{cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that are divided by
cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohorts or change their names. If you need
   to make changes to the way you have configured cohorts feature while your
   course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor after the opening
   brace character (``{``) and press Enter.

#. On the new line, you define the ``"auto_cohort_groups":`` policy key,
   followed by one or more cohort names enclosed by square brackets (``[ ]``).
   You can define a set of auto cohorts or just one.

   To define a set of cohorts, you type each cohort name on a new line, enclose
   it within quotation marks (``" "``), and separate the quoted name values
   with commas. For example:
   
   .. code:: 

      "auto_cohort_groups": [
          "Example Cohort Name A",
          "Example Cohort Name B",
          "Example Cohort Name C"
      ]
   

.. comment is here only to allow indented formatting of next line

  You can also define only a single auto cohort. Type ``"auto_cohort_groups":
  ["Example Cohort Name"]`` and then press Enter again.

5. Type a comma after the closing square bracket character (``],``). You must
   include a comma to separate each of the policy keys that you define.
   
#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio resequences and reformats your entry. Scroll
   back to the **Cohort Configuration** field to verify that your entry was
   saved as you expect. Entries that do not contain all of the required
   punctuation characters revert to the previous value when you save, and no
   warning is presented.

 .. image:: ../Images/Multiple_auto_cohort_groups.png

        with three values

.. spacer line

 .. image:: ../Images/Single_auto_cohort_group.png
  :alt: Cohort Configuration dictionary field with the auto_cohort_groups key 
        with one value

Any student who is not already assigned to a cohort will be randomly assigned to
one of the auto cohorts when she visits any of the course discussion topics.


.. _Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement manual assignment of students to cohorts, you define manual cohorts
and then assign students to them.

You complete these procedures if you are using either the manual or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All Manual
Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

You must :ref:`enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>` for your course
before you can complete these procedures.


.. _Define Manual Cohorts:

======================
Define Manual Cohorts
======================

Before you define your manual cohorts, note that students can see the name of
the cohort they are assigned to. The message "This post is visible only to
{cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that are divided by
cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohorts or change their names. If you need 
 to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature while your
 course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Click **Add Cohort**.

#. Supply a name for the cohort, and then click **Save** below the **New Cohort
   Name** field.


.. _Assign Students to Cohorts Manually:

====================================
Assign Students to Cohorts Manually
====================================

.. note:: Manual assignments should be as complete as possible before your 
 course starts. If student enrollment continues after your course starts, you
 should continue to assign new students to cohorts. 

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Select a cohort from the drop down list.

#. In the **Add students** field, enter the username or email address of a
   single student, or enter multiple names or addresses separated by commas or
   new lines. You can copy data from a CSV file of email addresses and paste it
   into this field.

#. Click **Add Students**. The students are assigned to the selected manual
   cohort. A message appears to indicate the number of students who were added to
   the cohort. Because students can belong to only one cohort, the message also
   indicates the number of students whose assignment to another cohort was changed
   by this procedure.

For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See :ref:`View
and download student data`.


.. _Assign Students to Cohort Groups by uploading CSV:

========================================================
Assign Students to Cohorts by Uploading a CSV File
========================================================

In addition to assigning students to cohorts by entering usernames or email
addresses directly on the Membership page in the Instructor Dashboard, you can
also upload a .csv file containing a list of students and the cohorts that you
want to assign them to.

Any assignments to cohorts that you specify in the .csv files you upload
will overwrite or change existing cohort assignments. The configuration of
your cohorts should be complete and stable before your course begins. You
should also complete manual cohort assignments as soon as possible after any
student enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while your course is
running. To understand the effects of changing cohort assignments after your
course has started, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. note:: Be aware that the contents of the .csv file are processed row by row,
  from top to bottom, and each row is treated independently. 

  For example, if your .csv file contains conflicting information such as
  Student A being first assigned to Cohort 1, then later in the spreadsheet
  being assigned to Cohort 2, the end result of your .csv upload is that Student
  A is assigned to Cohort 2. However, the upload results file will count Student
  A twice in the "Students Added" count: once when they are added to Cohort 1,
  and again when they are added to Cohort 2. Before submitting a file for
  upload, check it carefully for errors.

The requirements for the .csv file are summarized in this table.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Requirement**
      - **Notes**
    * - Valid .csv file

      - The file must be a properly formatted comma-separated values file: 

        * The file extension is .csv.
        * Every row must have the same number of commas, whether or not there
          are values in each cell. 
    * - File size
      - The file size of .csv files for upload is limited to a maximum of 2MB.               
    * - UTF-8 encoded
      
      - You must save the file with UTF-8 encoding so that Unicode characters
        display correctly. 

        See :ref:`Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File`.

    * - Header row
      - You must include a header row, with column names that exactly match those 
        specified in "Columns" below.
    * - One or two columns identifying students      
      - You must include at least one column identifying students: 
        either "email" or "username", or both. 

        If both the username and an email address are provided for a student,
        the email address has precedence. 
        
        In other words, if an email address is present, an incorrect or non-
        matching username is ignored.

    * - One column identifying the cohort
            
      - You must include one column named "cohort" to identify the cohort
        to which you are assigning each student.

        The specified cohorts must already exist in Studio.

    * -                        
      - Columns with headings other than "email", "username" and "cohort" are
        ignored.

Follow these steps to assign students to cohorts by uploading a .csv file.
      
#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio, click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Under **Assign students to cohorts by uploading a CSV file**, click
   **Browse** to navigate to the .csv file you want to upload. 

#. Click **Upload File and Assign Students**. A status message displays
   above the **Browse** button.

#. Verify your upload results on the **Data Download** page. 

   Under **Reports Available for Download**, locate the link to a .csv file with
   "cohort_results" and the date and time of your upload in the filename. The
   list of available reports is sorted chronologically, with the most recently
   generated files at the top.

The results file provides the following information:  

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Column**
      - **Description**
    * - Cohort
      - The name of the cohort to which you are assigning students.
    * - Exists
      - Whether the cohort was found in the system. TRUE/FALSE. 
      
        If the cohort was not found (value is FALSE), no action is taken for students you assigned to that cohort in the .csv file.

    * - Students Added
      - The number of students added to the cohort during the row by row
        processing of the .csv file.             
    * - Students Not Found
      - A list of email addresses or usernames (if email addresses were not
        supplied) of students who could not be matched by either email address
        or username and who were therefore not added to the cohort.
             
For a report that includes the cohort assignment for every enrolled student,
review the student profile information for your course. See :ref:`View and
download student data`.


.. _Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File:

====================================
Creating a Unicode-encoded CSV File
====================================

Make sure the .csv files that you upload are encoded as UTF-8, so that any
Unicode characters are correctly saved and displayed.

.. note:: Some spreadsheet applications (for example, MS Excel) do not allow you
   to specify encoding when you save a spreadsheet as a .csv file. To ensure that
   you are able to create a .csv file that is UTF-8 encoded, use a spreadsheet
   application such as Google Sheets, LibreOffice, or Apache OpenOffice.


.. _Altering Cohort Configuration:

*************************************************
Altering Cohort Configuration in a Running Course
*************************************************

The configuration of the cohort feature should be complete and stable before
your course begins. Manual cohort assignments should be completed as soon as
possible after any student enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while
your course is running. 

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and activity in the course discussion begins, be sure that you understand the
consequences of these actions:

* :ref:`Changing Student Cohort Assignments`
* :ref:`Renaming a Cohort`
* :ref:`Deleting a Cohort`
* :ref:`Disabling the Cohort Feature`


.. _Changing Student Cohort Assignments:

=================================
Change Student Cohort Assignments
=================================

After your course starts and students begin to contribute to the course
discussion, each post that they add is visible either to everyone or to the
members of a single cohort. When you change the cohort that a student is
assigned to, there are three results:

* The student continues to see the posts that are visible to everyone.

* The student sees the posts that are visible to his new cohort.

* The student no longer sees the posts that are visible only to his original
  cohort.

The visibility of a post and its responses and comments does not change, even if
the cohort assignment of its author changes. To a student, it can seem that
posts have "disappeared".

To verify the cohort assignments for your students, download the  :ref:`student
profile report<View and download student data>` for your course. If changes are
needed, you can :ref:`assign students<Assign Students to Cohorts Manually>` to
different cohorts manually on the **Membership** page of the Instructor
Dashboard.


.. _Renaming a Cohort:

===============
Rename a Cohort
===============

Name changes for cohorts are not supported. The **Membership** page of the
Instructor Dashboard does not offer an option to rename your manual cohorts.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, changing the names in the
listed name:value pairs **does not** result in any renamed auto cohorts.
Instead, changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these
results.

* The system uses the new value that you saved for the ``auto_cohort_groups``
  policy key to create one or more additional auto cohorts.

* The system begins to assign students who do not have a cohort assignment to
  the newly defined cohort or cohorts. Students also continue to be assigned to
  any auto cohorts that were not affected by your changes.

  The system uniformly distributes students among all of the auto cohorts that
  exist when an assignment is needed. The size of each cohort is not considered.

* The original cohort or cohorts remain in the system. Any students who were
  assigned to the original cohorts remain assigned to them.

  For the results of assigning any students who remain in the original cohorts
  to other cohorts, see :ref:`Changing Student Cohort Assignments`.

* The system converts the original auto cohorts, which are no longer listed as
  values for ``auto_cohort_groups``, into manual cohorts. The system no longer
  assigns students to those cohorts automatically. These cohorts are listed as
  manual cohorts on the **Membership** page of the Instructor Dashboard.


.. _Deleting a Cohort:

================
Delete a Cohort
================

Deletion of cohorts is not supported. The **Membership** page of the Instructor
Dashboard does not offer an option to delete your manual cohorts.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, removing any of the listed
name:value pairs **does not** result in the deletion of any cohorts. Instead,
changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these results.

* The cohorts that you removed from the policy key remain in the system.

* Any students who were assigned to those cohorts remain assigned to them. 
  
  For the results of assigning any students to other cohorts, see :ref:`Changing
  Student Cohort Assignments`.

* The system no longer assigns students to the cohorts automatically. 

* The cohorts are listed as manual cohorts on the **Membership** page of the
  Instructor Dashboard, and you can continue to assign students to them
  manually.


.. _Disabling the Cohort Feature:

==========================
Disable the Cohort Feature
==========================

You can disable the cohort feature for your course. Follow the instructions for
:ref:`enabling the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>`, but set ``"cohorted":
false``. All discussion posts immediately become visible to all students.

If you do re-enable the cohort feature by setting ``"cohorted": true``, all
previous student cohort assignments are reenabled, and all visibility settings
for posts are reapplied. However, any posts created while the cohort feature
was disabled will remain visible to all users.
