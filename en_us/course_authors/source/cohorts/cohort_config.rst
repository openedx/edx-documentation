.. _Enabling and Configuring Cohorts:

############################################
Enabling and Configuring the Cohort Feature
############################################

To support cohorts in your course, you select a strategy for assigning your
students to cohort groups: automated assignment, manual assignment, or a hybrid
approach. See :ref:`Options for Assigning Students to Cohorts`. You also decide
whether to change any of the course-wide discussion topics so that they are
divided by cohort instead of unified for all students.

After you select a strategy, you complete these configuration steps (as
applicable):

#. :ref:`Enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>`.

#. Based on the strategy you select for assigning students to cohort groups:
   
  * :ref:`Define the auto cohort groups<Define Auto Cohort Groups>`.

  * :ref:`Define the manual cohort groups<Define the Manual Cohort Groups>` and
    then :ref:`assign students<Assign Students to Cohort Groups
    Manually>` to them.

  * Do both. 

3. Identify the :ref:`course-wide discussion topics<Identifying Private
   CourseWide Discussion Topics>` that you want to be divided by cohort. This
   procedure is optional.

You complete these procedures in Studio and on the Instructor Dashboard. For an
optimal student experience, configuration of the cohort feature should be as
complete as possible prior to the start date of your course. 

If you need to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature
while your course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. _Enable Cohorts:

********************************
Enabling the Cohort Feature
********************************

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor between the
   supplied pair of braces.

#. Type ``"cohorted": true``. 

#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio reformats the name:value pair you just
   entered to indent it on a new line.

        as true

You can then :ref:`implement the automated assignment strategy<Implementing the
Automated Assignment Strategy>`, :ref:`implement the manual assignment
strategy<Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy>`, or both.

.. _Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Automated Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement automated assignment of students to cohort groups you define the
auto cohort groups in the **Cohort Configuration** advanced setting field.

You complete this procedure if you are using either the automated or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All
Automated Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

.. _Define Auto Cohort Groups:

============================================
Define the Auto Cohort Groups
============================================

Before you define your auto cohort groups, note that students can see the name
of the cohort group they are assigned to. The message "This post is visible
only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that are
divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohort groups or change their names. If you need
   to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature while your
   course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. Open the course in Studio. 

#. Select **Settings**, then **Advanced Settings**.

#. In the **Cohort Configuration** field, place your cursor after the opening
   brace character (``{``) and press Enter.

#. On the new line, you define the ``"auto_cohort_groups":`` policy key,
   followed by one or more cohort group names enclosed by square brackets (``[
   ]``). You can define a set of auto cohort groups or just one.

   To define a set of groups, you type each group name on a new line, enclose
   it within quotation marks (``" "``), and separate the quoted name values
   with commas. For example:
   
 .. code:: 

   "auto_cohort_groups": [
       "Example Group Name A",
       "Example Group Name B",
       "Example Group Name C"
   ]
   
.. comment is here only to allow indented formatting of next line

  You can also define only a single auto cohort group. Type
   ``"auto_cohort_groups": ["Example Group Name"]`` and then press Enter again.

5. Type a comma after the closing square bracket character (``],``). You must
   include a comma to separate each of the policy keys that you define.
   
#. Click **Save Changes**. Studio resequences and reformats your entry. Scroll
   back to the **Cohort Configuration** field to verify that your entry was
   saved as you expect. Entries that do not contain all of the required
   punctuation characters revert to the previous value when you save, and no
   warning is presented.

 .. image:: ../Images/Multiple_auto_cohort_groups.png

        with three values

.. spacer line

 .. image:: ../Images/Single_auto_cohort_group.png
  :alt: Cohort Configuration dictionary field with the auto_cohort_groups key 
        with one value

Any student who is not already assigned to a cohort group will be randomly
assigned to one of the auto cohort groups when she visits any of the course
discussion topics.

For a report that includes the cohort group assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.

.. _Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy:

***************************************************
Implementing the Manual Assignment Strategy
***************************************************

To implement manual assignment of students to cohort groups, you define the
manual cohort groups and then assign students to them. 

You complete these procedures if you are using either the manual or hybrid
assignment strategy for your course. For more information, see :ref:`All Manual
Assignment` or :ref:`Hybrid Assignment`.

You must :ref:`enable the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>` for your course
before you can complete these procedures.


.. _Define the Manual Cohort Groups:

==========================================
Define the Manual Cohort Groups
==========================================

Before you define your manual cohort groups, note that students can see the
name of the cohort group they are assigned to. The message "This post is
visible only to {cohort name}" appears with each post in discussion topics that
are divided by cohort. See :ref:`Read the Cohort Indicator in Posts`.

.. note:: You cannot delete cohort groups or change their names. If you need 
 to make changes to the way you have configured the cohort feature while your
 course is running, please see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Click **Add Cohort Group**.

#. Supply a name for the group, and then click **Save** below the **New Cohort
   Name** field.

.. _Assign Students to Cohort Groups Manually:

==========================================
Assign Students to Cohort Groups Manually
==========================================

.. note:: Manual assignments should be as complete as possible before your 
 course starts. If student enrollment continues after your course starts, you
 should continue to assign new students to cohort groups. 

#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Select a cohort group from the drop down list.

#. In the **Add students** field, enter the username or email address of a
   single student, or enter multiple names or addresses separated by commas or
   new lines. You can copy data from a CSV file of email addresses and paste it
   into this field.

#. Click **Add Students**. The students are assigned to the selected manual
   cohort group. A message appears to indicate the number of students who were
   added to the cohort group. Because students can belong to only one cohort
   group, the message also indicates the number of students whose assignment to
   another cohort group was changed by this procedure.

For a report that includes the cohort group assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.


.. _Assign Students to Cohort Groups by uploading CSV:

========================================================
Assign Students to Cohort Groups by Uploading a CSV File
========================================================

In addition to assigning students to cohort groups by entering usernames or
email addresses directly on the Membership page in the Instructor Dashboard, you
can also upload a .csv file containing a list of students and the cohort groups
you want to assign them to.

Any assignments to cohort groups that you specify in the .csv files you upload
will overwrite or change existing cohort group assignments. The configuration of
your cohort groups should be complete and stable before your course begins. You
should also complete manual cohort assignments as soon as possible after any
student enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while your course is
running. To understand the effects of changing cohort assignments after your
course has started, see :ref:`Altering Cohort Configuration`.

.. note:: Be aware that the contents of the .csv file are processed row by row,
 from top to bottom, and each row is treated independently. For example, if your
 .csv file contains conflicting information such as Student A being first
 assigned to Cohort Group 1, then later in the spreadsheet being assigned to
 Cohort Group 2, the end result of your .csv upload is that Student A is assigned
 to Cohort Group 2. However, the upload results file will count Student A twice
 in the "Students Added" count: once when they are added to Cohort Group 1, and
 again when they are added to Cohort Group 2. Before submitting a file for
 upload, check it carefully for errors.

The requirements for the .csv file are summarized in this table.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Requirement**
      - **Notes**
    * - Valid .csv file

      - The file must be a properly formatted comma-separated values file: 

        * The file extension is .csv.
        * Every row must have the same number of commas, whether or not there
          are values in each cell. 
    * - File size
      - The file size of .csv files for upload is limited to a maximum of 2MB.               
    * - UTF-8 encoded
      
      - You must save the file with UTF-8 encoding so that Unicode characters
        display correctly. 

        See :ref:`Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File`.

    * - Header row
      
      - You must include a header row, with column names exactly matching those
        specified in "Columns" below, including case.
        
    * - One or two columns identifying students      
      - You must include at least one column identifying students: 
        either "email" or "username", or both. 

        If both the username and an email address are provided for a student,
        the email address has precedence. 
        
        In other words, if an email address is present, an incorrect or non-
        matching username is ignored.

    * - One column identifying the cohort group
            
      - You must include one column named "cohort" to identify the cohort group
        to which you are assigning each student.

        The specified cohort groups must already exist in Studio.

    * -                        
      - Columns with headings other than "email", "username" and "cohort" are
        ignored.

Follow these steps to assign students to cohort groups by uploading a .csv file.     
      
#. View the live version of your course. For example, in Studio, click **View
   Live**.

#. Click **Instructor**, then click **Membership**. 

#. Scroll to the **Cohort Management** section at the bottom.

#. Under **Assign students to cohort groups by uploading a CSV file**, click
   **Browse** to navigate to the .csv file you want to upload. 

#. Click **Upload File and Assign Students**. A status message displays
   above the **Browse** button.

#. Verify your upload results on the **Data Download** page. 

   Under **Reports Available for Download**, locate the link to a .csv file with
   "cohort_results" and the date and time of your upload in the filename. The
   list of available reports is sorted chronologically, with the most recently
   generated files at the top.

The results file provides the following information:  

.. list-table::
    :widths: 15 30

    * - **Column**
      - **Description**
    * - Cohort Group
      - The name of the cohort group to which you are assigning students.
    * - Exists
      - Whether the cohort group was found in the system. TRUE/FALSE. 
      
        If the cohort group was not found (value is FALSE), no action is taken for students you assigned to that group in the .csv file.

    * - Students Added
      - The number of students added to the cohort group during the row by row
        processing of the .csv file.             
    * - Students Not Found
      - A list of email addresses or usernames (if email addresses were not
        supplied) of students who could not be matched by either email address
        or username and who were therefore not added to the cohort group.
             
For a report that includes the cohort group assignment for every enrolled
student, review the student profile information for your course. See
:ref:`View and download student data`.


.. _Creating a Unicode Encoded CSV File:

====================================
Creating a Unicode-encoded CSV File
====================================

Make sure the .csv files that you upload are encoded as UTF-8, so that any
Unicode characters are correctly saved and displayed.

.. note:: Some spreadsheet applications (for example, MS Excel) do not allow you
   to specify encoding when you save a spreadsheet as a .csv file. To ensure that
   you are able to create a .csv file that is UTF-8 encoded, use a spreadsheet
   application such as Google Sheets, LibreOffice, or Apache OpenOffice.



.. _Altering Cohort Configuration:

*****************************************************************
Altering Cohort Configuration in a Running Course
*****************************************************************

The configuration of the cohort feature should be complete and stable before
your course begins. Manual cohort assignments should be completed as soon as
possible after any student enrolls, including any enrollments that occur while
your course is running. 

If you decide that you must alter cohort configuration after your course starts
and activity in the course discussion begins, be sure that you understand the
consequences of these actions:

* :ref:`Changing a student's cohort group assignment<Changing Student Cohort
  Group Assignments>`

* :ref:`Renaming a cohort group<Renaming a Cohort Group>`

* :ref:`Deleting a cohort group<Deleting a Cohort Group>`

* :ref:`Disabling the cohort feature<Disable the Cohort Feature>`

.. _Changing Student Cohort Group Assignments:

=============================================
Change Student Cohort Group Assignments
=============================================

After your course starts and students begin to contribute to the course
discussion, each post that they add is visible either to everyone or to the
members of a single cohort group. When you change the cohort group that a
student is assigned to, there are three results:

* The student continues to see the posts that are visible to everyone.

* The student sees the posts that are visible to his new cohort group.

* The student no longer sees the posts that are visible only to his original
  cohort group.

The visibility of a post and its responses and comments does not change, even
if the cohort group assignment of its author changes. To a student, it can
seem that posts have "disappeared".

To verify the cohort group assignments for your students, download the 
:ref:`student profile report<View and download student data>` for your course. 
If changes are needed, you can :ref:`assign students<Assign Students to Cohort 
Groups Manually>` to different cohort groups manually on the **Membership** 
page of the Instructor Dashboard.

.. _Renaming a Cohort Group:

==========================
Rename a Cohort Group
==========================

Name changes for cohort groups are not supported. The **Membership** page of
the Instructor Dashboard does not offer an option to rename your manual cohort
groups.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, changing the names in the
listed name:value pairs **does not** result in any renamed auto cohort groups.
Instead, changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these
results.

* The system uses the new value that you saved for the ``auto_cohort_groups``
  policy key to create one or more additional auto cohort groups.

* The system begins to assign students who do not have a cohort group
  assignment to the newly defined cohort group or groups. Students also
  continue to be assigned to any auto cohort groups that were not affected by
  your changes.

  The system uniformly distributes students among all of the auto cohort groups
  that exist when an assignment is needed. The size of each group is not
  considered.

* The original cohort group or groups remain in the system. Any students who
  were assigned to the original groups remain assigned to them.

  For the results of assigning any students who remain in the original cohort
  groups to other groups, see :ref:`Changing Student Cohort Group Assignments`.

* The system converts the original auto cohort groups, which are no longer
  listed as values for ``auto_cohort_groups``, into manual cohort groups. The
  system no longer assigns students to those groups automatically. These cohort
  groups are listed as manual cohort groups on the **Membership** page of the
  Instructor Dashboard.

.. _Deleting a Cohort Group:

==========================
Delete a Cohort Group
==========================

Deletion of cohort groups is not supported. The **Membership** page of
the Instructor Dashboard does not offer an option to delete your manual cohort
groups.

It is possible to change the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key on
the **Advanced Settings** page in Studio. However, removing any of the listed
name:value pairs **does not** result in the deletion of any cohort groups.
Instead, changing the value for the ``auto_cohort_groups`` policy key has these
results.

* The cohort groups that you removed from the policy key remain in the system.

* Any students who were assigned to those groups remain assigned to them. 
  
  For the results of assigning any students to other groups, see :ref:`Changing
  Student Cohort Group Assignments`.

* The system no longer assigns students to the groups automatically. 

* The groups are listed as manual cohort groups on the **Membership** page of
  the Instructor Dashboard, and you can continue to assign students to them
  manually.

.. _Disable the Cohort Feature:

==============================
Disable the Cohort Feature
==============================

You can disable the cohort feature for your course. Follow the instructions for
:ref:`enabling the cohort feature<Enable Cohorts>`, but set ``"cohorted":
false``. All discussion posts immediately become visible to all students.

If you do reenable the cohort feature by setting ``"cohorted": true``, all
previous student cohort assignments are reenabled, and all visibility settings
for posts are reapplied. However, any posts created while the cohort feature
was disabled will remain visible to all users.
