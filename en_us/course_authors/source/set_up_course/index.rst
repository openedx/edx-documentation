Setting Up a Course
###################

Xhen you begin to set up a course, the first step is to plan and specify two
types of basic information.

* **Course** information, such as the course title and number, remains true
  whether the course runs one time or multiple times.
* **Course run** information, such as the course staff and start date,
  can change every time the course runs.

After you plan your course and course run information, you enter it into either
Publisher or Studio, depending on whether your course will be on edx.org or on
Edge.

* **For courses on edx.org**, you plan your course and course run information,
  and then you enter that information in Publisher. Publisher is a companion to
  Studio and is used to create About pages. For more information, see :ref:`Pub
  Creating and Announcing a Course`.

* **For courses on Edge**, you plan your course and course run information, and
  then you enter that information in Studio. For more information, see
  :ref:`Partner Add Studio Information`.
