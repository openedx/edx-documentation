Setting Up a Course
###################

When you begin to set up an edX course, your goal may be to start entering
course content into Studio as soon as possible. Or, your goal may be to create
an About page for your course so that edX can announce your course on edx.org.

No matter which of these tasks you want to accomplish, the first step is to
plan and specify two types of basic information about your course.

* **Course** information remains true whether the course runs one time or
  multiple times. This is information such as the course title and number,
  subject, and course description.
* **Course run** information changes every time the course runs. This is
  information such as the course staff and start and end dates.

When you are ready to create a course, you enter this information in
:ref:`edX Publisher <Introduction to Publisher>`. Publisher is a companion
to Studio. EdX uses the information that you enter in Publisher in two ways.

.. note::
   Some course and course run information must be entered into both Publisher
   and Studio. EdX must create a Studio URL before you can enter information
   or other course content into Studio.

* **If your goal is to enter course content in Studio**, you enter a small
  amount of specific course and course run information in Publisher. EdX will
  then create a Studio URL for a course run, and you can add lessons and modify
  settings in Studio.

* **If your goal is to create a course About page**, you enter the required
  information in Publisher, as well as a limited amount of information in
  Studio. EdX then creates an About page for your course run and publishes the
  About page on edx.org.

This section provides information about how to determine required course and
course run information, as well as how to enter this information into Publisher
and Studio.
