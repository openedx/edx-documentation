Creating and Announcing a Course in Publisher
#############################################

When you create a course for edx.org, you also help create the announcement for
that course. The most important part of an announcement is the About page.

The About page is the page that learners see when they select the course card
on edx.org. The page lists the information that potential learners need to know
about your course, including a short and long description, subject,
instructors, dates the course is offered, and more. You create the course About
page in edX Publisher.

The topics in this section provide an introduction to the Publisher tool and
describe the Publisher process, from the time the course team creates a course
to the time the About page is published on edx.org.
