Creating and Announcing a Course Using Publisher
################################################

.. note::
  This process applies to courses on the edx.org site. If your course will run
  on Edge, you create the course and the About page in Studio. For more
  information, see :ref:`Creating a New Course` or :ref:`Creating a Course
  About Page`.

When you are ready to create a course, you add your course information in the
Publisher tool. You must add course information in Publisher as a first step in
the About page process before you can add course content in Studio.

The topics in this section provide an introduction to the Publisher tool and
describe the Publisher process, from the time the course team creates a course
to the time the About page is published on edx.org.

For more information about how to determine information such as a course
description or the course schedule, see :ref:`Planning Course Information` or
:ref:`Planning Course Run Information`.
