Creating and Announcing a Course
################################

When you are ready to create a course, you add your course information in the Publisher tool. You must add course information in Publisher as a first step in the About page process before you can add course content in Studio.

The topics in this section provide an introduction to the Publisher tool and
describe the Publisher process, from the time the course team creates a course
to the time the About page is published on edx.org.

For more information about how to determine information such as a course
description or the course schedule, see :ref:`Planning Course Information` or
:ref:`Planning Course Run Information`.
