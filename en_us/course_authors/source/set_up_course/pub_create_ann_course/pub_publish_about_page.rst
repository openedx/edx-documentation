After the course and course run have been finalized and all Studio information
has been entered, the edX publisher creates a preview for the About page for
the course run.

When the edX publisher creates a preview for an About page, a link to the About
page preview becomes available on the course run page. Additionally, the
Publisher tool sends an email notification to the course team with a link to
the course run page. The course team can then review, and accept or decline,
the preview.

To accept or decline an About page preview, follow these steps.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the About page preview.

   * Select the link in the email message. (?)
   * Open the preview from the dashboard.

     #. On the **Dashboard** page, select the **In Preview** tab.
     #. In the list, locate the course run that you want.
     #. Under **Preview URL**, select the link for the course run.

   * Open the preview from the course run page.

     #. Open the course run page.
     #. Under **About Page Preview**, select **View About page preview**.

   The preview for the About page opens.

#. Review the About page preview carefully.
#. Accept or decline the preview.

   * To accept the preview, return to the page for the course run, and then
     select **Accept**.
   * To decline the preview, follow these steps.

     #. Return to the page for the course run, and then select **Decline**.
     #. In the **Reason for declining preview** field, enter a comment, and
        then select **Submit**.

   If the course team declines the preview, the course team works with the edX
   PC to make any necessary changes. The edX publisher then creates a new About
   page preview for the course team to review.
