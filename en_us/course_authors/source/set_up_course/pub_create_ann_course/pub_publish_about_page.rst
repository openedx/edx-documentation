After the course team has :ref:`finalized the course run <Pub Finalize a Course
Run>`, the About page for the course run is almost ready to be published on
edx.org. The process of publishing an About page in Publisher includes the
following steps.

#. The course team :ref:`verifies that all necessary information has been
   entered in Studio <Pub Verify Studio Information>`.
#. The edX publisher creates a preview of the About page and sends the preview
   to the course team.
#. The course team :ref:`accepts or declines the preview <Pub Accept or Decline
   the Preview>`. If the course team declines the preview, the course team
   works with edX until the course team accepts the preview.
#. The edX publisher publishes the About page on edx.org.
#. The course team :ref:`views the published About page <Pub View the Published
   About Page>`.

.. _Pub Accept or Decline the Preview:

****************************************
Accept or Decline the About Page Preview
****************************************

After the course and course run have been finalized and all Studio information
has been entered, the edX publisher creates a preview for the About page for
the course run.

When the edX publisher creates a preview for an About page, a link to the About
page preview becomes available on the course run page. Additionally, the
Publisher tool sends an email notification to the course team with a link to
the course run page. The course team can then review, and accept or decline,
the preview.

To accept or decline an About page preview, follow these steps.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the About page preview.

   * Select the link in the email message.
   * Open the preview from the dashboard.

     #. On the **Dashboard** page, select the **In Preview** tab.
     #. In the list, locate the course run that you want.
     #. Under **Preview URL**, select the link for the course run.

   * Open the preview from the course run page.

     #. Open the course run page.
     #. Under **About Page Preview**, select **View About page preview**.

   The preview for the About page opens.

#. Review the About page preview carefully.
#. Accept or decline the preview.

   * To accept the preview, return to the page for the course run, and then
     select **Accept**.
   * To decline the preview, follow these steps.

     #. Return to the page for the course run, and then select **Decline**.
     #. In the **Reason for declining preview** field, enter a comment, and
        then select **Submit**.

   If the course team declines the preview, the course team works with the edX
   PC to make any necessary changes. The edX publisher then creates a new About
   page preview for the course team to review.


.. _Pub View the Published About Page:

*****************************

*****************************

After the course team has accepted the About page preview for a course run, the
edX publisher publishes the About page on edx.org.

When the edX publisher publishes the About page on edx.org, a link to the About
page becomes available on the course run page. Additionally, the Publisher tool
sends an email notification to the course team with a link to the About page.
The course team can use either of these links to view the published About page.

For information about how to update course run information after the About page has been published, see :ref:`Pub Change a Course Run`.
