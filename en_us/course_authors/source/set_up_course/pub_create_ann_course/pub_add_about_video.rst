Add a Course or Program About Video
##########################################

When you add an About video for a course or a program, you upload the video to
the edX/Veda video upload page. For course About videos, but not program About
videos, you then enter the URL for the About video in Publisher.

To add an About video for a course or program that is running on edx.org,
follow these steps.

#. Locate the video file on your computer. For example, if you use a Mac
   computer, open Finder and go to the directory that contains the video file.

#. In your browser, go to the edX/Veda video upload page at
   http://veda.edx.org/upload/.

#. Enter a title for the video that includes the course number and name or the
   program name. For example, the title might be ``edx101: Creating an edX
   Course`` or ``edx VideoX XSeries: Creating Video for the edX Platform``.

   You can abbreviate the full name of the course or program. However, the
   information that you enter should clearly identify your course or program.

#. For a **course** About video, enter the Studio URL for the course in the
   **edX Studio Course URL** field. For example,
   ``https://studio.edx.org/course/course-v1:edX+edX101x+2015``.

   For a **program** About video, locate the **edX Studio Course URL** field,
   and then add identifying information about the program to the Studio URL
   that is provided. For example,
   ``https://studio.edx.org/course/XSeries_edX_VideoX``.

   The value that you enter in this field does not need to resolve to an actual
   URL, but it must begin with ``https://studio.edx.org/course/``.

#. Select **Submit**.

#. Drag the video file from the local directory into the **Drop files here to
   upload** field. You can also click inside this field to browse to the file.

   The file upload process begins immediately.

   .. important::
     Do not close the browser tab or window, or use it to go to another URL
     while the file is uploading. When the upload process is complete, the
     message "File Upload Complete" appears.

#. (For course videos only) In Publisher, add the About video URL to the page
   for the course. For more information, see :ref:`Pub Create a Course`.
