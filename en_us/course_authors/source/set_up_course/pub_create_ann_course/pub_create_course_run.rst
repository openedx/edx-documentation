In Publisher, a course contains the following information. Most of this
information is required before edX can publish an About page for your course.

.. note::
 Course information remains true for every run of the course. Course run
 information changes each time the course is run.

* Start and end date
* Certificate types and price
* Course staff
* Estimated effort
* Languages for course content, videos, and transcripts
* Course length (in weeks)

.. note::
 Course certificates are associated with course runs. However, you configure
 course certificates in Studio.

The process of creating a course in Publisher includes the following steps.

.. note::
 You can create and edit a course run at any time after you create a course.
 However, you must finalize a course before you can send a course run to the
 edX PC for review.

#. :ref:`The course team creates the course run<Pub Create a Course Run>`. In
   this step, the course team provides only basic information about the course
   run, and Publisher creates a page for the course run.
#. :ref:`The course team edits the course run <Pub Edit a Course Run>`, adding
   all required information.
#. :ref:`The course team receives a Studio URL <Pub Receive a Studio URL>` from
   the edX PC.

   Send a Course for SEO Review>`.

   finalizes the course <Pub Review Changes and Finalize the Course>`.

     bottom of the page, and then select **Create New Course**.

#. On the **New Course Run** page, enter the following information.

   .. note::
    If you selected **Add a Course Run** on the dashboard, you must first
    select the course for the course run in the **Find Course** list.

     (UTC).
   * Course pacing.
   * Available certificate types, if any, and the prices for the certificates.

The page for the course run opens. This page lists the course run information
that you have entered and the additional course run information that is
required for edX to create an About page.

At the top of the course run page, "breadcrumbs" are visible that list the name
of the course and the course run. For example, the breadcrumbs may be ``Courses
> Creating an edX Course > Self-paced: June 1, 2017``.

> Creating an edX Course > Self-paced: June 1, 2017``.

#. Use one of the following methods to open the page for the course run.

   .. note::
    You can identify a course run by the course run's pacing and start date.

     course run that you want. You can identify the course run by the start
     date.

   run, you can add the information that you have, and return to the course run
   page at another time.

Receive a Studio URL for a Course Run
**************************************

.. note::
 You can edit a course run before you receive a Studio URL for the course run.
 However, you cannot send the course run to the PC for review until the course
 run has a Studio URL.

When you create a course run, Publisher automatically sends a notification to
the edX PC asking the edX PC to create a Studio URL for the course run. This
process can take up to two business days.

When the edX PC creates the Studio URL, this information automatically appears
in the **Studio URL** field on the course run page. Additionally, Publisher
sends an email notification to the course team that the Studio URL has been
created. The email notification contains a link to the course run in Studio and
to the course run page in Publisher.

After the edX PC has created the Studio URL for the course run, the course team
has the the following options.

* Enter content for the course run in Studio. To access the course run in
  Studio, select the link in the notification email, or select the **Studio
  URL** link on the course run page.
* Continue editing the course run in Publisher. For more information, see
  :ref:`Pub Edit a Course Run`.
* Send the course run to the edX PC for review. For more information, see
  :ref:`Pub Send a Course Run for Review`.

   * On the dashboard, select the **In Development** tab, and then select the
     course run that you want. You can identify the course run by the start
     date.
