Proctored Exam Overview
############################

This section provides an overview of how to set up and use proctored exams in
for-credit courses.

  :depth: 1

Proctored exams are exams with time limits that learners complete while online
proctoring software monitors their computers and behavior for activity that
might be evidence of cheating.

In for-credit courses, course teams can create exams that they designate as
proctored exams, and require that learners pass these exams as one of the
requirements for credit eligibility.

.. note:: Only learners who are enrolled in the verified track see the option
   to take an exam with online proctoring. If you believe that there are
   students who have not yet upgraded to the verified track who should be
   taking proctored exams and qualifying for course credit, you should remind
   them to enroll in the verified track before the deadline for upgrading.

Learners in the verified track can choose to take the exam as proctored and be
eligible for course credit, or take the exam as an open exam and not be
eligible for course credit. For more information about creating proctored
exams in Studio, see :ref:`Create a Proctored Exam`.

You can also :ref:`create a practice proctored exam <Create a Practice
Proctored Exam>` for your course so that learners can become familiar with the
process of installing proctoring software and performing the required checks
ahead of time.

To satisfy the proctored exam requirement for credit eligibility, learners
must take the exam as a proctored exam and receive a **Satisfactory** result
for their proctoring session review as well as a passing grade on the exam
itself. For more information about proctored session review results, see
:ref:`Proctored Exam Session Results`.

For information about for-credit courses and specifying the passing score for
credit eligibility, see :ref:`Academic Course Credit` and :ref:`Specify
Minimum Credit Eligible Grade`.


*****************************************************
Learner Requirements for Taking Proctored Exams
*****************************************************

.. note:: Learners cannot complete proctored exams using the edX mobile app.

Learners who agree to take an exam with online proctoring must install
proctoring software, which checks that the person taking the exam is the same
person who is taking the course for credit, and also detects any attempts to
cheat on the exam. Learners perform a series of checks on their computer and
test environment and must also provide photo identification before being
allowed to proceed. The proctoring software then runs in the background,
monitoring the test environment and screen activity as the learner takes the
exam.

For more information about the technical requirements for taking a proctored
exam, and edX's :ref:`online proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`, see
:ref:`Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams`.

.. note:: Course staff should familiarize themselves with edX's :ref:`online
   proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`, which reflect our proctoring
   software partner's "Closed Book Exam" rules. These strict rules prohibit
   learners from using any tools during the exam, including pencil and
   paper, calculators, or reference books.

   If a particular exam in your course has a less stringent exam policy, or if
   you want to allow a particular tool (for example, a calculator or pencil and
   paper), you can enter custom rules or rule exceptions for your exam. It is
   important that the rules for your exam, if different from the "closed book"
   rules, are communicated to the proctored exam reviewers so that learners'
   exam attempts are not incorrectly disqualified. For more information, see
   :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.


.. _Proctored Exam Session Results:

***********************************
Proctored Exam Session Results
***********************************

When learners complete a proctored exam, either by submitting their answers or
when the time expires for the exam, the proctoring session data is uploaded to
the third party proctoring service provider. A team of reviewers examines the
data to determine whether the learner complied with the :ref:`Online Proctoring
Rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`. When the review is complete, the proctoring
service returns the results for each learner.

Before proctoring session results are available, learners see a **Pending**
result. After their proctoring sessions are available, learners can receive
either a **Satisfactory** or **Unsatisfactory** result.

Learners can check their proctoring session results by returning to the
proctored exam in the course. Their proctoring session review results are
updated there when results are received. In addition, learners can go to their
**Progress** pages, where they can check their proctored exam results as a
part of their overall credit eligibility status.

Course staff can download a report that lists proctoring results for learners
in their course. For more information, see :ref:`Proctored Session Results`.


.. _CA_LearnerExperience_Proctored Exams:

*********************************************
The Learner Experience of Proctored Exams
*********************************************

Only learners who have signed up for the verified track in your course have
the option of taking proctored exams. When they access a proctored exam,
learners on the verified track can choose to take the exam with online
proctoring, or to take the exam without proctoring and as an open exam with no
time limit.

If learners choose to take the exam without proctoring, they are not eligible
for credit for the exam, and will not be offered the proctored option for that
exam again.

Learners who are not ready to make the choice or take the exam immediately can
defer their decision and return to the exam again at some other time before
the due date.

.. Question for Griff or Julia

.. Do we want to give advice to course staff about planning an adequate due
.. date?  e.g. allow more time than normal for allow proctoring results to come
.. back? Allow time for administrative tasks, especially as edX support needs
.. to be involved in creating extra time allowances. Course staff need to allow
.. enough time to get confirmations back from Support and also to notify
.. students. If resolution of any technical difficulty disputes is needed,
.. students also need adequate time to retake the exam.


=============================
Taking a proctored exam
=============================

When learners agree to take the exam with online proctoring, they are guided
through the process of installing the proctoring software and performing
system and user checks, including ID verification. They must be ready to take
the exam as soon as the proctoring session setup is completed. For details,
see :ref:`Steps In Taking Proctored Exams` in the *edX Learner's Guide*.

After learners successfully complete the checks, the proctoring session starts.
Learners are reminded not to close the proctoring software window. They are
prompted to return to the browser window where the course is open, and to
start taking the exam.

A countdown timer is visible at the top of the page during the exam. Warnings
are displayed when there is 20% and 5% of allotted time remaining. For example,
if the allowed time in the exam is 60 minutes, learners see a warning when
there are 12 minutes remaining, and again when there are 3 minutes remaining.

For information about scenarios that learners might encounter while taking
proctored exams, see :ref:`Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams`
and :ref:`CA_Situations_Learners_Encounter_Proctored_Exams`.


=============================
Completing a proctored exam
=============================

When learners complete the exam, or when the countdown timer reaches 00:00,
they no longer have access to the exam. Learners are reminded to quit the
proctoring session, and the proctoring software begins the process of
uploading the captured session data.

On the proctored exam page in the LMS, learners see a status of "Pending" for
their proctoring session results until their session data has been reviewed.
They can return to this page in the course or check their **Progress**
pages in the LMS for updates to their proctoring review results.



.. _Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams:

*************************************************
Preparing Learners for Proctored Exams
*************************************************

Well before the exam is due, provide learners with information about the
grading policy of your course, and make it clear what the requirements are for
earning credit.

Explain what proctored exams are, and provide learners with links to the
Learner's Guide topics about proctored exams, and to edX's :ref:`online
proctoring rules <Online Proctoring Rules>` in the *edX Learner's Guide*.

.. note:: Course staff should familiarize themselves with edX's :ref:`Online
   Proctoring Rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`, which reflect our proctoring
   software partner's "Closed Book Exam" rules. These strict rules prohibit
   learners from using any tools during the exam, including pencil and
   paper, calculators, or reference books.

   If a particular exam in your course has a less stringent exam policy, or if
   you want to allow a particular tool (for example, a calculator or pencil and
   paper), you can enter custom rules or rule exceptions for your exam. It is
   important that the rules for your exam, if different from the "closed book"
   rules, are communicated to the proctored exam reviewers so that learners'
   exam attempts are not incorrectly disqualified. For more information, see
   :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.

Emphasize that learners must be aware of the requirements before taking the
exam, and that some of the requirements might take some preparation.

You can also create a practice proctored exam that is visible to all learners.
This ungraded exam provides an opportunity for learners to experience the
proctoring software setup process and make sure their computers are compatible
with the software. For more information, see :ref:`Create a Practice Proctored
Exam`.

.. note:: In an actual proctored exam, as soon as learners agree to take the
   exam with online proctoring and start the process of installing the
   proctoring software, they must continue through to taking the exam as soon
   as that process is completed.

The following list represents only some of the requirements listed in the
:ref:`online proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`.

* System and environment checks that learners are asked to perform for the
  proctoring session include taking a photo of themselves and a photo of a photo
  ID using the webcam on their computer.

  In addition, they must use the webcam to provide a scan of the room that
  they will take the current exam in. The scan includes the desk area, the
  area under their desk, and a view around the whole room.

* Learners must sit at a clean desk or table that has been cleared of all
  materials such as phones, books, notebooks, pens, and papers. They cannot
  sit on a bed or couch to take the proctored exam.

* No writing can be visible on the desk or walls in the test environment.

* The computer on which a learner takes the exam must not have a secondary
  monitor connected.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, the learner cannot leave the room
  for any reason.

* Once the exam starts and until it ends, no other person can enter the room
  for any reason.

* The learner cannot talk to anyone or communicate by any means with another
  person during the exam.

* Learners cannot have music or the television playing in the background during
  the exam. They cannot use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of
  listening equipment.
