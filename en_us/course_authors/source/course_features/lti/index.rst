Using edX as an LTI Tool Provider
######################################

The edX Edge site can be configured to be a learning tool interoperability
(LTI) provider to other systems and applications that partner institutions use.
After initial configuration and testing between Edge and your system or
application is complete, course teams can use this feature to reuse Edge course
content, including advanced problem types and videos, in an on campus or in
house learning management system. Examples currently include courses running on
Canvas and Blackboard.

.. note:: Support for this feature is provisional. EdX is currently working
 with a set of early adopter partners in a closed pilot to test this
 feature.

.. This note ^ can be removed after we get a better sense of how we'll do testing with new consumers, and regression testing for code changes. We'll also need to provide some direction on how they would line up this work (probably though partner manager) - Alison 16 Sept 15

You use the topics in this section to prepare a course for reuse in another
context.
