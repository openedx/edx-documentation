#############################################

Use the topics in this section to learn about setting up grading for your
course. Establishing a grading policy requires several steps, including
deciding whether to include ungraded sections in your course.

.. important:: Any changes to the course grading policy, to graded
 subsections, or to graded components after a course begins will affect the
 student experience in the course and analysis of its data.

For information on how to develop your course content in the Studio Outline,
see :ref:`Developing Your Course Index`.
