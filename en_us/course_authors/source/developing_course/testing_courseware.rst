Testing Your Course Content
###########################

The way your course looks in Studio is not the way that students will see and
experience it when it is live. 

It is recommended that you test your content continually as you build your
course, so you can interact with your course from a student's point of view.

To test your content, you can:

* `Preview Course Content`_
* `View Your Live Course`_

.. note:: If you use content groups in your course to designate content as
  visible only to particular students, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific
  Courseware`.

For information about setting up a beta test for your course, see
:ref:`Beta_Testing`.

.. _Preview Course Content:

*************************
Preview Course Content
*************************

You preview course content before you publish it to test how it will look to
students.
 
When you preview course content, you see the latest course content as configured
in Studio. You see content in units with the publishing status :ref:`Draft
(Never Published)`, :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, or :ref:`Visible to
Staff Only`. 

If you use content groups and have designated components in a unit as visible
only to particular groups, the visibility status indicates that some content in
the unit is visible only to particular groups. For information about previewing
course content if you use content groups to designate content as visible only to
particular groups, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

For example, you :ref:`publish a unit<Publish a Unit>` with a video and
discussion:

.. image:: ../Images/test-unit-studio.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video and discussion

Students see the same content in the LMS:

.. image:: ../Images/test-unit-lms.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video and discussion

You later decide to add a multiple choice problem to the unit, before the
discussion:

.. image:: ../Images/test-unit-studio-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in Studio with a video, problem, and discussion

Before you publish this change, you can see what the question will look to
students.

When you click **Preview Changes**,  you see the unit in the LMS with
the multiple choice question:

.. image:: ../Images/test-unit-lms-added-comp.png
 :alt: A unit in the LMS with a video, problem, and discussion

This preview shows how students will experience the unit after you
:ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>`.

In the live course, students continue to see the same content, without the
multiple choice question, until you :ref:`publish the change<Publish a Unit>`.

.. note:: 
  **Preview Changes** in not available when the unit's state is :ref:`Published
  and Live`, because in this case the preview and live version are exactly the
  same. You can view the live course to see the published content.

 
.. _View Your Live Course:

******************************************
View Your Live Course
******************************************

When you are working in Studio, you can test your course by viewing it in the
LMS. In the LMS, you can see your course as a student sees it. You can see your
course in `Staff View`_ or `Student View`_. If you are using content groups to
designate specific content as visible only to particular content groups, you can
see your course as a content group would see it.

While you work in Studio, you can switch to your live course to see how your
course appears to students in two ways.

* From the outline page, click **View Live**.
   
  .. image:: ../Images/test-outline-view-live.png
   :alt: View live button on the outline

* In a unit page, click **View Live Version**.
   
  .. image:: ../Images/test-unit-view-live.png
   :alt: View Live Version button on the unit page

=================
Staff View
=================

You see the course in the **Staff View**.

.. image:: ../Images/Live_Course_Staff_View.png
 :alt: Image of the Courseware page in a live course with Staff View indicated
     at top right and a View Unit in Studio button
 
In **Staff View**:

* You see all units that are :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)` or :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`, you
  see the last published version of the unit. You see these units
  regardless of the release dates of the containing section or subsection.

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)`. To
  see these units, you must use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview
  Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you :ref:`run your course<Running Your Course Index>`.

When you view your course in **Staff View**, you can execute tests to make sure
that your course works the way you intend. For example,  before the release
date of a subsection, members of the course team can work through the problems
to verify that the correct answer gets a green check for correct, and that any
answer other than the correct one gets a red X for incorrect.

============
Student View
============

When viewing your course in the LMS, you can use the **Student** view to see the
course with all course content that is intended for all students.

.. note:: If you have enabled your course for cohorts and have designated some
  content as visible only to certain content groups, you can select a content
  group from the **View Course As** drop down list to see the content exactly
  as a student in a cohort associated with that content group will see it. For
  details, see :ref:`Preview Cohort Specific Courseware`.

To switch to the **Student** view, click **View this course as** and select
**Student** from the drop down list.

.. image:: ../Images/test-view-as-student.png  
   :alt: Image of the View Course As drop down list with Staff, Student, and named content group options

In **Student View**:

* You do not see sections or subsections that have not yet been released.

* If the section and subsection are released, you see units that are
  :ref:`Published and Live`. For units that are
  :ref:`Draft (Unpublished Changes)`, you see the last published version of the
  unit. 

* You do not see units that are :ref:`Draft (Never Published)` or
  :ref:`Visible to Staff Only`. To see these units, you must switch back to Instructor view or use Preview mode as described in :ref:`Preview Course Content`.

* You can access the Instructor Dashboard, which has features and reports that
  help you run your course.
