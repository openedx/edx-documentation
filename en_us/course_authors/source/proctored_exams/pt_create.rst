Create a Proctored Exam with Proctortrack

After you enable proctored exams with Proctortrack for your course, you can create proctored exams.

To create a proctored exam for Proctortrack, you first create a single Onboarding exam subsection in your course, and then create one or more proctored exam subsections.

The Onboarding exam is a practice proctored experience which ensures the learner’s 
computer passes system requirements and establishes the learner’s identity 
with Verificient by creating an onboarding profile.  


*****************************************
Creating an Onboarding Subsection
*****************************************


Proctortrack requires all learners to complete an onboarding process before 
they take a proctored exam. In the onboarding process, learners download and
install the necessary client software and verify their identity with 
Proctortrack.


.. note::  Onboarding includes a mandatory identity verification step which 
   establishes an identity baseline with Verificient. This is required to gain access to the first Proctored Exam, and can take 5+ business days for learners to complete, so we recommend you:

   * Create an Onboarding subsection in the first section of any course using 
     Proctortrack proctoring, as described below.

   * Add in-course messaging that completing Onboarding early is important, and that access to Onboarding requires to be in a paid track (e.g. Verified or Master’s).

   * Nudge learners who have not yet completed Onboarding a week before the first proctored exam.
   
   This identity baseline is aged off every 1 year. A valid baseline will work across future Proctortrack courses on edX.org as well, but we recommend learners re-take Onboarding as a practice exam in every course, to make sure their current system is still ready for proctoring in advance of each proctored exam.  

To set up Proctortrack onboarding for your course, follow these steps.

#. Add and :ref:`develop a subsection <Developing Course Subsections>` as you
   would any other subsection.

##. Change the name to something clear to learners, like “Proctortrack Onboarding”.

##. As in the note above, add instructions to learners, explaining why it is important to complete Onboarding early

##. Position the Onboarding subsection at an early stage in your course - we recommend positioning it in the first section.


#. Select the **Configure** icon for the subsection.

#.  The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. In the **Grading** section, set the :ref:`assignment type and due date<Set
   the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>` for the subsection.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then locate the **Set as a Special Exam**
   section.

#. Select the exam type to **Onboarding**.

   .. note::
      Once the exam content has been released to students, the special 
      exam type cannot be modified.

#. Select **Save**.
