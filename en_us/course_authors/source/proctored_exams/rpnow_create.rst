After you enable proctored exams for your course, you can create a proctored
exam or a practice exam using your choice of either RPNow or Proctortrack. 
To create a proctored exam or a practice proctored exam for RPNow, follow these 
steps.

  .. note::
    Practice proctored exams are visible to all learners, regardless of
    enrollment track.

#. Add and :ref:`develop a subsection <Developing Course Subsections>` as you
   would any other subsection.

   For a practice proctored exam, edX recommends that you include only a few
   problems in this subsection. Or, you could add a unit with a text component
   that provides information about the exam.

#. Select the **Configure** icon for the subsection.

   .. image:: ../../../shared/images/subsections-settings-icon.png

   The **Settings** dialog box opens to the **Basic** tab.

#. In the **Grading** section, set the :ref:`assignment type and due date<Set
   the Assignment Type and Due Date for a Subsection>` for the subsection.

   .. note::
    For a practice proctored exam, leave the assignment type as **Not Graded**.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then locate the **Set as a Special Exam**
   section.

#. Select the proctored exam type.

   * For a proctored exam, select **Proctored**.
   * For a practice proctored exam, select **Practice Proctored**.

   .. note::
      Once the exam content has been released to students, the special 
      exam type cannot be modified.

#. In the **Time Allotted** field, enter the length of time that you want
   to allow for the exam as HH:MM, where HH is hours and MM is minutes.

#. (optional) For a proctored exam, in the **Review Rules** field, enter any
   additions or exceptions to the :ref:`default rules for proctored exams<Online Proctoring Rules>`. For more information, see
   :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.

#. Select **Save**.

**************************************
Specify Exam Rules and Exceptions
**************************************

By default, reviewers evaluate exam attempts according to a standard set of
:ref:`online proctoring rules <Online Proctoring Rules>` that the
proctoring service has provided.

.. note::
  The course grace period setting does not apply to proctored exams. For more
  information about the grace period setting, see :ref:`Set the Grace Period`.

You can also provide custom rules for a particular exam. For example, you might
allow learners to use a calculator, or to have one sheet of blank paper. These
rules are visible to reviewers and learners at the start of each proctoring
exam.

To specify custom proctored exam rules, follow these steps.

  .. note::

    Your additional rules must be clear, specific, and easy to understand so
    that reviewers do not incorrectly review a learner’s exam. Use simple
    sentences and words for a global English speaking audience.

#. In Studio, open your course outline and select the subsection for the exam.

#. Select the **Configure** icon to open the **Settings** dialog box.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab, and then locate the **Set as a Special Exam**
   section.

#. In the **Review Rules** field, enter any additional rules. For example, you
   might enter the following rule.

   ``Allow one blank sheet of paper and a pencil or pen. Allow a hand-held
   calculator on the desk.``

#. Select **Save**.
