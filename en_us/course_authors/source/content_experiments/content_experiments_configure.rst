Configure Your Course for Content Experiments
#####################################################

This chapter describes how to configure your course so that you can use content
experiments. See:

* :ref:`Enable Content Experiments`
* :ref:`Overview of Group Configurations`
* :ref:`Set up Group Configurations in edX Studio`
* :ref:`Guidelines for Modifying Group Configurations`
* :ref:`Set Up Group Configuration for OLX Courses`

.. _Enable Content Experiments:

****************************************
Enable Content Experiments
****************************************

To enable content experiments in your course, you add ``split_test`` to the
**Advanced Modules List** in Advanced Settings.

.. note::  
  ``split_test`` is the internal edX Platform name for a content experiment.

#. From the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. On the **Advanced Settings** page, locate **Advanced Modules List**.

#. In the **Advanced Modules List** field, add ``"split_test"``. Be sure that
   you include the double quotation marks.

   If you have multiple values, ensure that they are separated by commas
   (``,``).

   For example, the text in the **Advanced Modules List** field may resemble
   the following:

   .. code-block:: json
     
     [
       "lti",
       "word_cloud",
       "split_test"
     ]

#. At the bottom of the page, click **Save Changes**.

.. _Overview of Group Configurations:

****************************************
Overview of Group Configurations
****************************************

Before you can create content experiments, you must specify at least one group
configuration for your course.

A group configuration defines how many groups of students are in an experiment.
You can have any number of group configurations in your course. When you create
a content experiment, you select the group configuration to use.

For example, you may want to do two different experiments at different times
during your course. In one content experiment, students either see a video or
complete a reading assignment. You can then include problems so that you can
see which group learned the material more completely. For this content
experiment, you need a group configuration that assigns your students to two
experiment groups.

In the other content experiment, you can present the same question using four 
different types of problems. For this content experiment, you need a
group configuration that assigns your students to four experiment groups.

=======================================
Assigning Students to Experiment Groups
=======================================

The edX Platform assigns students to each experiment group in a group
configuration.

Experiment group assignments are:

* Dynamic

  The edX Platform assigns a student to an experiment group the first time he or
  she views a content experiment that uses the group configuration.

* Random
  
  You cannot control which students are assigned to which experiment group. 
  
* Evenly distributed
  
  The edX Platform keeps track of the size of experiment groups, and assigns new
  students to groups evenly. For example, if you have two experiment groups in a
  configuration, each group includes 50% of the students in the course; if you
  have four experiment groups, each group includes 25% of the students.

* Permanent
  
  Students remain in their assigned experiment groups regardless of how many
  content experiments you set up that use the same group configuration.


.. _Set up Group Configurations in edX Studio:

************************************************
Set up Group Configurations in edX Studio 
************************************************

.. note:: 
  You must :ref:`enable content experiments<Enable Content Experiments>` before
  you can set up group configurations.

To set up group configurations, on the **Settings** menu, select **Group
Configurations**. The **Group Configurations** page opens.

From this page you can :ref:`create<Create a Group Configuration>`,
:ref:`edit<Edit a Group Configuration>`, and :ref:`delete<Delete a Group
Configuration>` group configurations. You can also :ref:`view experiments that
use a group configuration<View Experiments that Use a Group Configuration>`.

.. _Create a Group Configuration:

=============================
Create a Group Configuration
=============================

You can create a group configuration at any time.

#. On the **Group Configurations** page, under **Experiment Groups**, click
   **New Experiment Group**. The following page opens:

  .. image:: ../Images/create-group-config.png
   :width: 800
   :alt: Create a New Group Configuration page

2. Enter a name in the **Group Configuration Name** field. Use a meaningful
name, because you will select from group configuration names when you create
content experiments. Students do not see the group configuration name.

#. Optionally, enter a description for the new group configuration.
   
#. By default, a new configuration already contains two groups. Modify the
   groups or add and delete groups as needed. A group configuration must have at
   least one group.

  * Modify group names as needed. You see group names in the unit page in
    Studio, but group names are not visible to students.       
  * Click **Add another group** to include another group as part of
    the configuration. 
  * Click the **X** to the right of an existing group to remove it from the
    configuration. A group configuration must have at least one group.

5. Click **Create** to save the new group configuration.
   
The group configuration is then listed in the page. You can see the number of
groups that the configuration contains, as well as whether the configuration is
in use in the course:

 :width: 800
 :alt: The Group Configurations page with one group configuration


  
.. _Edit a Group Configuration:

=============================
Edit a Group Configuration
=============================

.. important:: You can change the name of a group configuration at any time.
   However, before you modify any other characteristics of a group configuration
   that is currently used in a running course, review `Guidelines for Modifying
   Group Configurations`_.

#. On the **Group Configurations** page, hover over the group configuration and
   click **Edit**.
   
   .. image:: ../Images/group_configurations_edit.png
    :alt: The Group Configurations page with Edit button

   The following page opens:

   .. image:: ../Images/save-group-config.png
    :alt: Edit a Group Configuration page

#. Modify the name and description as needed.

#. Modify groups in the configuration as needed. See `Create a Group
   Configuration`_ for details.
   
#. Click **Save** to save your changes.

.. _Delete a Group Configuration:

=============================
Delete a Group Configuration
=============================

.. note:: 
 You can only delete a group configuration that is not currently used in a
 content experiment. You cannot delete a group configuration that is used in a
 content experiment.

#. On the **Group Configurations** page, hover over the group configuration and
   click the Delete icon. 

  .. image:: ../Images/group-configuration-delete.png
   :alt: Edit a Group Configuration page

2. When prompted to confirm the deletion, click **Delete**.


.. _View Experiments that Use a Group Configuration:

===============================================
View Experiments that Use a Group Configuration
===============================================

You can view the experiments that use each of your group configurations.

On the **Group Configurations** page, click the name of a group to see its
details. You see links to experiments that use the group configuration:

.. image:: ../Images/group_configurations_experiments.png
 :alt: A group configuration with the experiments using it circled

Click a link to go to the unit page that contains the experiment.


===============================================
View a Group Configuration from an Experiment
===============================================

When working with a content experiment, you can view details about the group
configuration used by that experiment in two ways:

* In a unit that contains a content experiment, in the content experiment block,
  click the name of the group configuration.

.. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_group_config_link.png
 :alt: Content experiment in the unit page with the group configuration link
     circled

* At the top of the content experiment page, click the name of the group
  configuration.

.. image:: ../Images/content_experiment_page_group_config_link.png
 :alt: Content experiment page with the group configuration link circled

In both cases, the group configuration opens:

.. image:: ../Images/group_configurations_experiments.png
 :alt: A Group Configuration with the experiments using it circled

You can use the link in the group configuration to return to the unit that
contains the content experiment.
