Using edX as an LTI Tool Provider
######################################

The edX Edge site is configured to be a learning tool interoperability (LTI)
provider to other systems and applications. You can use this LTI capability to
present content from an edX course on Edge in any application that is
configured to be a consumer of that content. As a result, you can reuse edX
course content, including advanced problem types and videos, in contexts other
than the edX LMS. Examples include courses running on Canvas, Blackboard, and
other learning management systems.

You use the topics in this section to prepare your course for reuse.

You can also include content from an LTI provider in your edX courses. For
