Academic Course Credit
#####################################

If your institution has an agreement with edX, you might be able to offer
academic credit for your course. Learners will be able to purchase this
academic credit after they meet requirements that you set. These requirements
typically include periodic identity checks throughout the course as well as ID
verification at the beginning of the course. Learners can see a list of the
requirements on their **Progress** pages.

If your course offers academic credit, your edX program manager will
complete the initial setup of your course, including setting the price of
credit and enabling your course to offer credit. You must then complete two
steps.

#. :ref:`Specify the minimum grade that a learner must earn to receive
   academic credit in the course <Specify Minimum Credit Eligible Grade>`.
#. :ref:`Add identity checks to the course <Add Identity Checks>`.

.. _Specify Minimum Credit Eligible Grade:

********************************************
Specify the Minimum Credit-Eligible Grade
********************************************

In addition to setting the usual grade scale for your course, you indicate a
specific grade that learners must receive to earn credit for your course.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Grading**.
#. In the **Credit Eligibility** section, specify a grade followed by
   a percent sign (%) in the **Minimum Credit-Eligible Grade** box.
   This grade can be any number from 1 to 100.

.. _Add Identity Checks:

Add Identity Checks

For courses that offer academic credit, edX has two forms of identity checks:
in-course reverification and proctored exams. You can use either feature or
both features in your course.

* In-course reverification allows you to add identity verification
  "checkpoints" at specific locations in your course, such as before
  assessments or exams. When learners reach a checkpoint, they must use the
  webcams on their computers to verify their identity, similar to the original
  ID verification process, before they can access more course content.

  For more information, see :ref:`In Course Reverification`.

* Proctored exams are timed exams that learners take while being monitored by
  online proctoring software. Only learners who have enrolled in the verified
  track see the proctored exam option in the courseware, and can choose
  whether they want to take the exam with online proctoring. If they decline
  the proctored option, they can take the exam with no monitoring and no time
  limit, but they will not be eligible to earn academic credit for the course,
  regardless of their final grade. Honor code learners see the same exam in
  the courseware, but without the proctored exam option. They take the exam as
  an open exam, with no monitoring and no time limit.

  For more information, see :ref:`CA_ProctoredExams`.
