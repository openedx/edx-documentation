#####################################
Offering Academic Course Credit
#####################################

If your institution has an agreement with edX, you might be able to offer
academic credit for your course. Learners will be able to purchase this
academic credit after they meet requirements that you set. These requirements
typically include periodic identity checks throughout the course as well as ID
verification at the beginning of the course. Learners can see a list of the
requirements on their **Progress** pages.

If your course offers academic credit, your edX program manager will complete
the initial setup of your course, including setting the price of credit and
enabling your course to offer credit. You must then complete the following
steps.

#. :ref:`Specify the minimum grade that a learner must earn to receive
   academic credit in the course <Specify Minimum Credit Eligible Grade>`.
#. :ref:`Determine which identity checks you want to use and add identity
   checks to the course <Add Identity Checks>`. We recommend that you read the
   information about each type of identity check before you decide which type
   or types you want to use. Adding an identity check involves several steps.

.. _Specify Minimum Credit Eligible Grade:

Specify the Minimum Credit-Eligible Grade
********************************************

In addition to setting the usual grade scale for your course, you indicate a
specific grade that learners must receive to earn credit for your course.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, and then select **Grading**.
#. In the **Credit Eligibility** section, specify a grade in the **Minimum
   Credit-Eligible Grade** box. This grade must be greater than or equal to
   the passing grade for the course.

For more information about grading, see :ref:`Establish a Grading Policy`.

.. _Add Identity Checks:

For courses that offer academic credit, edX offers the following identity
checks: in-course identity reverification and proctored exams. You can use either
feature or both features in your course.

* In-course identity reverification allows you to add identity verification
  "checkpoints" at specific locations in your course, such as before
  assessments or exams. When learners reach a checkpoint, they must use the
  webcams on their computers to verify their identities, similar to the
  original ID verification process, before they can access more course content.

  For more information, see :ref:`In Course Reverification`.

* Proctored exams...
