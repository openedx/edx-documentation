   This service is deprecated and was last tagged for the Redwood release. We are not fixing bugs or developing new features for it. For updates, `follow along on the DEPR ticket <https://github.com/openedx/public-engineering/issues/22>`_

After you install the basic features of the E-Commerce service on your instance
of the Open edX platform, you can enable or install additional features. You
can set up E-Commerce to send email, switch payment processors, or track event
data if one of your usual processors is unavailable.
