Changing an Open edX Theme
############################


The theme for a website defines the appearance of its user interface (UI): the
logo, the color scheme, and the links in the page headers and footers are
examples of different aspects of an Open edX site that are defined by the
theme.

Open edX provides a default theme that you can override by creating your
own versions of page templates, CSS styling, and assets such as the logo and
other images. You can change the appearance of the following parts of an Open
edX site.

* The Studio UI, which is used by course teams.

* The learning management system (LMS) UI, which is used by learners and course
  teams.

* The UI of the E-commerce service, which is used by course offering and order
  managers.

The topics in this section describe how you can change the way an Open edX
site looks, without changing how it works.
