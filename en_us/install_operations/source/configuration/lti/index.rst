Configuring an edX Instance as an LTI Tool Provider
########################################################

You can configure your edX instance to be a learning tool interoperability
(LTI) provider to other systems and applications. You can use this LTI
capability to present content from an edX course in any application that is
configured to be a consumer of that content. After you enable your edX instance
as an LTI tool provider and configure credentials for the tool consumers,
course teams can reuse course content from the edX instance in contexts other
than the edX LMS.

For more information and examples of how course teams might set up a course on
an external LMS as a consumer of edX course content, see

and Running an edX Course* guide.
