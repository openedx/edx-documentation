Installing an XBlock
##########################

The XBlock framework allows developers to expand the Open edX platform by
building different learning experiences and deploying them as XBlocks. Before
course teams can use an XBlock in courses running on an instance of the
Open edX platform, both of the following tasks must be completed.

* A system administrator installs the XBlock in the instance of the Open edX
  platform.

* Course teams enable the XBlock in the specific courses that will use it.

.. Future: link to an XBlock reference that would let people explore what's available and get both the GitHub commit string and the key. - Alison 22 Oct 2015

To install an XBlock, follow these steps.

#. Obtain the GitHub location and commit for the XBlock.

#. Run ``pip`` with a GitHub link to the XBlock.

   An example that installs the Oppia XBlock follows.

   .. code-block:: bash

     pip install git+https://github.com/oppia/xblock.git@9f6b95b7eb7dbabb96b77198a3202604f96adf65#egg=oppia-xblock==0.0.0


The course teams that want to include components that use the XBlock can then
enable the XBlock for their courses. To do so, they add the name specified in
the XBlockâ€™s ``setup.py`` file to each course's advanced module list. For more
information, see :ref:`opencoursestaff:Enable Additional Exercises and Tools`.
