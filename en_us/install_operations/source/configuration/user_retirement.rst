Enabling the User Retirement Feature
####################################

There have been many changes to privacy laws (for example, GDPR or the 
European Union General Data Protection Regulation) intended to change the way 
that businesses think about and handle Personally Identifiable Information 
(PII) data. 

As a step toward enabling Open edX to support some of the key updates in privacy
laws, edX has implemented APIs and tooling that enable Open edX instances to
retire registered users. When you implement this user retirement feature, your
Open edX instance can automatically erase PII for a given user from systems that
are internal to Open edX (for example, the LMS, forums, credentials, and other
independently deployable applications (IDAs)), as well as external systems, such
as third party marketing services. For more information, see `User Retirement`_.
