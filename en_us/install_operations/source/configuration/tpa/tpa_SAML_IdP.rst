Integrating with a SAML Identity Provider
##########################################

You can integrate your Open edX installation with federated identity solutions
that use the SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language, version 2.0)
standard. An example is Shibboleth, a single sign on system that is used by
many educational institutions.

******************
Exchange Metadata
******************

SAML metadata is an XML file that contains the information necessary for secure
interactions between identity providers and security providers. You send the
URL of your metadata file, created when you :ref:`configured your installation
as a SAML service provider<Configuring your Installation as a SAML Service
Provider>`, to each identity provider that you want to add. Similarly, you
obtain the metadata URLs from identity providers before you add and enable them
for your installation.

*******************************************
Add and Enable a SAML Identity Provider
*******************************************

To add and enable a SAML 2.0 identity provider, follow these steps.

#. Log in to the Django administration console for your base URL. For example,
   ``http://{your_URL}/admin``.

#. In the **Third_Party_Auth** section, next to **Provider Configuration
   (SAML IdPs)** select **Add**.

   .. note:: If you want to change the configuration of an existing provider,
    next to **Provider Configuration (SAML IdPs)** select **Change**, and then
    select **Update** for the provider that you want to configure.

3. Enter the following information for the provider.

 - **Icon class**: Specifies a `Font Awesome`_ image for the button that users
   will select to access the sign in page for this IdP. The **fa-sign-in** icon
   is used by default. For university or institutional providers, a suggested
   alternative is **fa-university**.

 - **Name**: The name of the IdP as you want it to appear on the sign in page.

 - **Secondary**: Select this option to include the IdP in an intermediary list
   of providers that users access from a **Use my institution/campus
   credentials** button on the sign in page.

 - **Backend name**: The default, **tpa-saml**, is optimized for use with Open
   edX and works with most SAML providers. Select a different option only
   if you have added a custom backend that provides additional functionality.

 - **IdP slug**: A short, unique name to identify this IdP in the URL. The slug
   becomes part of a URL, so the value that you enter cannot include spaces.

 - **Entity ID**: The URI that identifies the IdP. This ID must match
   the value specified in the metadata XML file.

 - **Metadata source**: The URL of the XML file that contains this provider's
   metadata.

4. Specify your selections for any of the other, optional configuration
   options. For more information about these options, see :ref:`Configuration
   Options for SAML Providers`.

#. When you are ready to enable the provider, select **Enabled** at the top of
   the page. Alternatively, save your configuration settings and enable the
   provider at another time.

#. Select **Save** or one of the other save options at the bottom of the page.

Next, you can :ref:`test an enabled provider<Test an Enabled SAML Provider>`.

.. _Configuration Options for SAML Providers:

*************************************************
Configuration Options for SAML Identity Providers
*************************************************

To customize the registration process for IdP, you make selections for these
optional fields on the Add Provider Configuration (SAML IdP) page.

* **Skip Registration Form**: If you select this option, users are not asked to
  confirm the user account data supplied for them by the IdP (name, email
  address, and so on). Select this option only for providers that are known to
  provide accurate user information.

  By default, users review a registration form with the supplied account
  details.

* **Skip Email Verification**: If you select this option, users are not
  required to confirm their email addresses, and their accounts are activated
  immediately upon registration.

  By default, users receive an email message and must select a link in that
  message to activate their user accounts.

* **User ID Attribute**: Required. This value is used to associate the user's
  edX account with the campus account. It is not displayed to users.

  By default, uses ``userid``, ``urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1``.

* Optional user attributes: You can indicate specific URN values for the
  following user attributes.

  By default, the registration form includes all of the following attributes if
  they are sent by the IdP.

  * **Full Name Attribute**: ``commonName``, ``urn:oid:2.5.4.3``
  * **First Name Attribute**: ``givenName``, ``urn:oid:2.5.4.42``
  * **Last Name Attribute**: ``surname``, ``urn:oid:2.5.4.4``
  * **Username Hint Attribute**: ``userid``,
    ``urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1``
  * **Email Attribute**: ``mail``, ``urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3``

  If the identity provider sends a value that you do not want to be included on
  the the registration form, you can enter a value such as "DISABLED" or
  "IGNORE" in that field.

.. _Test an Enabled SAML Provider:

*******************************************
Test an Enabled SAML Provider
*******************************************

To verify the sign in process for an IdP that you have enabled, follow these
steps.

#. On the Django administration console, in the **Third_Party_Auth** section,
   select **Provider Configuration (SAML IdPs)**.

#. Check the icon in the **Metadata ready** column for the IdP. After the
   provider's metadata is fetched successfully from the URL that you provided
   as the metadata source, a check mark in a green circle appears and the
   provider is ready for use immediately.

   You might need to wait 30-60 seconds for the task to complete, and then
   refresh this page.

   If the check mark does not appear, make sure that celery is configured
   correctly and is running. You can also manually trigger an update by running
   the management command ``./manage.py lms saml pull --settings=aws`` on
   Fullstack or ``./manage.py lms saml pull --settings=devstack`` on Devstack.

3. For additional information about the data fetched from the IdP, on the
   Django administration console select **SAML Provider Data**, and then select
   the provider. The page that opens reports data fetched from the metadata
   source URL and the date and time it was fetched.

#. To verify that users can use the IdP for sign in, go to the sign in page for
   your LMS. The page should include the institutional sign in button.

   .. image:: ../../Images/tpa_signin.png
     :alt: Screen shot of an LMS sign in page with a button labeled "Use my
         institutional/campus credentials" circled at the bottom.

5. Select **Use my institutional/campus credentials**. The list of providers
   that appears should include the IdP that you enabled.

   .. image:: ../../Images/tpa_inst_list.png
     :alt: Screen shot of the list of enabled IdPs. Each IdP name is linked to
         the sign in page for the corresponding authentication system.
