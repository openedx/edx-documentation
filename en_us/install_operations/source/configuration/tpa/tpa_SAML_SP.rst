Configuring your Installation as a SAML Service Provider
###############################################################

The first step in configuring your Open edX installation to act as a SAML SP
(service provider) is to create a credential key pair to ensure secure data
transfers with identity providers. To complete the configuration procedure, you
configure your Open edX installation as a SAML service provider which creates
your metadata XML file.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

After you complete this configuration, you can share your metadata file with
SAML identity providers, and configure them to assert identity and access
rights for users to your installation. For more information, see
:ref:`Integrating with a SAML Identity Provider`.

**********************************************
Generate Public and Private Keys
**********************************************

To generate the keys for your Open edX installation, follow these steps.

#. On your local computer or on the server, open Terminal or a Command Prompt
   and run the following command.

   ``openssl req -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out saml.crt -keyout saml.key``

#. Provide information at each prompt.

Two files, ``saml.crt`` and ``saml.key``, are created in the directory where
you ran the command.

**************************************************
Configure your Installation as a Service Provider
**************************************************

To configure your Open edX installation as a SAML service provider, follow
these steps.

#. Sign in to the Django administration console for your base URL. For example,
   ``http://{your_URL}/admin``.

#. In the **Third_Party_Auth** section, next to **SAML Configuration** select
   **Add**.

#. Select **Enabled**.

#. Enter the following information.

  - **Private key**: Use a text editor to open the ``saml.key`` file, and then
    copy the RSA private key into this field.

  - **Public key**: Use a text editor to open the ``saml.crt`` file, and then
    copy the certificate into this field.

  - **Entity ID**: Enter a URI for the server. To ensure that this value
    uniquely identifies your site, the naming convention that edX recommends is
    to include the server's domain name. For example,
    ``http://saml.mydomain.com/``.

  - **Organization Info**: Use the format in the example that follows to
    specify a language and locale code and identifying information for your
    installation.

    .. code:: json

     {
        "en-US": {
            "url": "http://www.mydomain.com",
            "displayname": "{Complete Name}",
            "name": "{Short Name}"
        }
     }

  - **Other config str**: Define the security settings for the IdP metadata
    files. For more information about the security settings, see the `Python SAML Toolkit`_. An example follows.

    .. code:: json

     {
        "SECURITY_CONFIG": {
          "signMetadata": false,
          "metadataCacheDuration": ""
        }
     }

5. Select **Save** at the bottom of the page. You can direct identity providers
   to ``{your LMS URL}/auth/saml/metadata.xml`` for your metadata file.

*******************************************************
Ensure that the SAML Authentication Backend is Loaded
*******************************************************

By default, SAML is included as an approved data format for identity providers.
The default configuration of the ``/edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json`` file does not
explicitly include the ``THIRD_PARTY_AUTH_BACKENDS`` setting.

If you have customized this file and added the ``THIRD_PARTY_AUTH_BACKENDS``
setting to it, you might need to verify that the
``third_party_auth.saml.SAMLAuthBackend`` python-social-auth backend class is
specified for it. That backend is required before you can add SAML IdPs.

To verify that the SAML authentication backend is loaded on a devstack or
fullstack installation, review the ``/edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json`` file.
