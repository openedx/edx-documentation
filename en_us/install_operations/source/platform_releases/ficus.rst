What's Included in Ficus
************************

The Open edX Ficus release contains several new features for learners,
course teams, and developers. For more information, see
:ref:`Open edX Ficus Release`.

What Is the Ficus Git Tag?

A git tag identifies the version of Open edX code that is the Ficus release.
You can find the most up-to-date git tag for the current Open edX release on
the `Open edX Releases Wiki page`_.

***************************************
Upgrading to a Subsequent Ficus Release
***************************************

Occasionally, we release updates to Ficus.  For example, the second 
release of Ficus is ``open-release/ficus.2``.
The steps to upgrade differ based on your original installation method.

================================
Upgrading a Vagrant Installation
================================

Devstack and Fullstack are installed using Vagrant.  To upgrade from one Ficus
release to another, run the following commands in the host operating system:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ export OPENEDX_RELEASE=open-release/ficus.2
    $ vagrant provision

===============================
Upgrading a Native Installation
===============================

If you installed Open edX using the `Legacy Open edX Native Installation`_, you can
upgrade from one Ficus release to another by re-running those steps using your
desired Ficus tag as the new value for ``OPENEDX_RELEASE``.
