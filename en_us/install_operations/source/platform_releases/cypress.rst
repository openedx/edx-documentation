******************************
Installing the Cypress Release
******************************

You can install the Open edX Cypress release using
:ref:`Devstack <Installing the Open edX Developer stack>` or
:ref:`Fullstack <Installing Open edX Fullstack>`.

Review the prerequisites and instructions for each option, and then choose the
option that best meets your needs. Ensure that you install the
required software to run the edX Platform.

If you are upgrading from the Birch release, see `Upgrading from Birch to
Cypress`_.

For new installations, follow these steps.

#. `Download the Vagrant Box`_ or `Download the BitTorrent File`_.

   .. caution::
     The Vagrant boxes have a large file size (about 2.5GB). If you have a slow
     or unreliable Internet connection, use BitTorrent to download the
     Vagrant box you need.

#. `Set the OPENEDX_RELEASE Environment Variable`_.

#. `Install the Vagrant Box`_.

=========================
Download the Vagrant Box
=========================

If you have a fast and reliable Internet connection, you can download the
Vagrant box directly or by running ``vagrant up`` when installing
:ref:`Devstack <Installing the Open edX Developer Stack>` or
:ref:`Fullstack <Installing Open edX Fullstack>`.

See the `Open edX Releases Wiki page`_ to access the latest Vagrant
boxes.

See `Vagrant's documentation on boxes`_ for more information.

=============================
Download the BitTorrent File
=============================

You can also download the BitTorrent file for the option you selected.
BitTorrent is recommended if you have a slow or unreliable data connection.
You then use the BitTorrent file to download the Vagrant box. If the Internet
connection is temporarily lost while you are downloading the Vagrant box
through BitTorrent, you can later continue the download without data loss or
corruption.

See the `Open edX Releases Wiki page`_ to access the latest Vagrant
boxes.

See `BitTorrent`_ for more information.

If you download the Vagrant box through BitTorrent, you must add the box to
Vagrant before continuing with the installation process.

* For devstack installations, run the following command.

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ vagrant box add /path-to-downloaded-box/name-of-vagrant-box --name
       cypress-devstack


* For fullstack installations, run the following command.

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ vagrant box add /path-to-downloaded-box/name-of-vagrant-box --name
       cypress-fullstack

============================================
Set the OPENEDX_RELEASE Environment Variable
============================================

Before installing the Vagrant box, you must set the value of the
``OPENEDX_RELEASE`` environment variable to the Git tag for the Cypress
release. Use the Linux ``export`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

  export OPENEDX_RELEASE="named-release/cypress"

=========================
Install the Vagrant Box
=========================

When you have completed the previous steps, install the Cypress release by
following the installation instructions for :ref:`Devstack <Installing the Open
edX Developer Stack>` or :ref:`Fullstack <Installing Open edX Fullstack>`.

********************************
Upgrading from Birch to Cypress
********************************

You can upgrade an Open edX instance that is running the Birch release to the
Cypress release, by using the ``migrate.sh`` script in the configuration
repository, `available here
<https://github.com/edx/configuration/blob/master/util/vagrant/migrate.sh>`_.

.. note::
  The upgrade scripts provided are verified only for upgrading instances
  running the Birch release. If you are running any other version of the Open
  edX Platform, the upgrade scripts might not work.

.. caution::
  Before upgrading your Open edX instance, back up all data and configuration
  files. Then verify that you can restore your Open edX instance from the
  backup files.

On the computer or virtual machine that is running the Birch release of Open
edX, run the upgrade script for your type of installation:

* For devstack, run ``./migrate.sh -c devstack``.

* For fullstack, run ``./migrate.sh -c fullstack``.

* You can also run ``./migrate.sh -h`` to see which other options the script
  accepts.

The script creates a temporary directory in which it upgrades Open edX, then
cleans up extra files and directories when it finishes running.

After upgrading Open edX to the Cypress release, start the LMS and Studio and
verify that course content and data was migrated correctly.
