This guide provides instructions for using your own instance of the Open edX
platform and associated applications.

This document applies to the :ref:`Hawthorn <Open edX
Hawthorn Release>` release, which is the most recent version of the Open edX

releases. 

You can install any release of the Open edX platform. For most situations, edX
recommends that you install the most recent release. However, if your
organization or project is currently running an earlier release, or your
software requires a specific release, you may want to install an earlier
release.
