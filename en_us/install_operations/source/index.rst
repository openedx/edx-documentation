Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform
###########################################################

This guide provides instructions for using your own instance of the Open edX
platform and associated applications.

The most recent Open edX release will be found on the `Open edX Named Releases page`_.
It is strongly recommended to use `Tutor`_ for both development and installation.
It is also recommended to stay up-to-date with the latest Open edX release, as
previous releases are unsupported by the community. See the `Open edX Release Schedule`_
for information on release dates and end-of-life support.

You *can* install any release of the Open edX platform, but note the community
will likely be unable to answer questions about issues you encounter. Please be
aware that older releases do not receive security fixes or any of the latest features,
and documentation on docs.openedx.org will always reflect the latest release.
