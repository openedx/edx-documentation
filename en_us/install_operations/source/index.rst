This guide provides instructions for using your own instance of the Open edX
platform and associated applications.

This document applies to the most recent version of the Open edX platform; that
is, it applies to the *master* branch of the edX platform.

This document also contains instructions for installing Open edX releases. The
most recent release of the Open edX platform is :ref:`Eucalyptus <Open edX
Eucalyptus Release>`.

You can install any release of the Open edX platform. For most situations, edX
recommends that you install the most recent release. However, if your
organization or project is currently running an earlier release, or your
software requires a specific release, you may want to install an earlier
release.
