As of the Sumac release, the Open edX community supports the
following Analytics solutions:

Aspects
*******

`Open edX Aspects <https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-aspects/en/latest/index.html>`_
is an optional implementation of analytics for the Open edX LMS. It is the combined solution
of Cairn by Overhang.io and the OARS project developed by Axim Collaborative with a huge amount
of help from the Open edX community. Primarily it is intended to be a "batteries included" set
of configurations and plugins to combine 3rd party tools into a powerful and flexible system for
learner analytics.

Cairn
*****

`Cairn <https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-cairn>`_ is a Tutor plugin that you install on top of an
Open edX instance and that gives you access to a powerful, full-blown analytics stack.
