Open edX Tutor Installation
###########################

Tutor is a supported installation method as of Lilac.  Because we expect Tutor
to completely replace the `Open edX Native Installation` installation for
Maple, we recommend its use for any new deployment of Lilac and above.

In order to avoid unnecessary duplication of information, please refer to the
official `Tutor`_ documentation for both details on how to use it and
differences from the Native Installation.
