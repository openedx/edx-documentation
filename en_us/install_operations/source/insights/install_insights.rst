Options for Installing edX Insights
##############################################

This topic is intended for those who are interested in running `edX Insights`_
and its dependencies in a production environment. This topic does not provide
complete installation procedures for edX Insights. It presents the introductory
material that is available now.

Overview
********

Course teams use edX Insights to access data gathered from active courses. In
edX Insights, course teams can display charts, summary statistics, and data
tables.

The Learning Management System (LMS) gathers data about learner activity. This
data is aggregated by the edX Analytics Pipeline. The aggregated data is
exposed by the edX Analytics Data API. EdX Insights reads the data from the edX
Analytics Data API and presents the data to course team members.

LMS
***

The LMS records learner actions in tracking log files. The standard
``logrotate`` utility periodically compresses and copies these files into a
file system that can be read by the edX Analytics Pipeline. The LMS also
captures a lot of information in a MySQL database. The edX Analytics Pipeline
connects directly to this database to extract information about learners.

edX Analytics Pipeline
**********************

The edX Analytics Pipeline reads the MySQL database used by the LMS as well as
the tracking log files produced by the LMS. The data is processed and the
resulting summary data is published to the result store. The result store is a
MySQL database.

Requirements
============

* `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org/>`_ version 1.0.3 or higher
* `Hive <https://hive.apache.org/>`_ version 0.11.0.2 or higher
* `Sqoop <http://sqoop.apache.org/>`_ version 1.4.5
* Python 2.7
* Either Debian version 6.0 or higher, or Ubuntu version 12.04 or higher
* A MySQL server version 5.6 or higher

Scheduler
*********

The Scheduler schedules the execution of data computation tasks. Data
computation tasks are run by the edX Analytics Pipeline. Data computation tasks
are used to update parts of the result store.

edX Analytics Data API
**********************

The ref:`opendataapi:edX Analytics Data API<edX Data Analytics API Overview>`
provides an HTTP interface for accessing data in the result store. Typically,
the data in the result store is updated periodically by the edX Analytics
Pipeline.

Requirements
============

Python 2.7

edX Insights
************

EdX Insights uses the edX Analytics Data API to present data to users. Users
access the data using a supported web browser. EdX Insights communicates
directly with the LMS to authenticate users, authorize users, and read course
structure information.

Requirements
============

Python 2.7

*************************************
What You Should Know Before You Start
*************************************

To install edX Insights and deploy the edX Analytics Pipeline, you must
understand the following concepts.

* Basic terminal usage.
* How the LMS has been deployed and configured.
* Basic computer network terminology.
* YAML file format.

If you plan to use Amazon Web Services, an understanding of AWS terminology is
also required.

************************
Planning Your Deployment
************************

All edX Analytics services are designed to be relocatable. This means that they
do not require a particular configuration of virtual servers. You are free to
choose how the services should be distributed among the resources you have
available.

======
Hadoop
======

Most of the computation performed by the edX Analytics Pipeline is implemented
as Map Reduce jobs that must be executed by a Hadoop cluster. You can scale
your Hadoop cluster based on your current and projected data sizes. Hadoop
clusters can be scaled vertically and horizontally as your data grows. For very
small installations of Open edX, a single virtual server should be sufficiently
powerful to process your data.

Amazon's `Elastic MapReduce`_ (EMR) service offers preconfigured Hadoop
clusters. If you are able to use Amazon Web Services (AWS), use of this service
is recommended. Proper installation and configuration of Hadoop can be time
consuming. For more information, see :ref:`Using Elastic MapReduce on AWS`.

Additionally, vendors such as Cloudera and MapR offer simplified Hadoop
administration experiences.

Hadoop is a distributed system that consists of several different services. It
is worth noting that they are Java services and require a non-trivial amount of
memory to run. The high memory requirement might prevent you from running all
services on the same virtual server if it does not have enough memory
available.

================
edX Applications
================

The edX Analytics Data API responds to a small number of requests every time a
page is loaded in edX Insights. Small installations can probably host both
services on the same virtual server. Larger installations should consider
hosting the services on more than one virtual server. A load balancer is
recommended for each service that requires more than one virtual server.

============
Result Store
============

The results of computations performed by the edX Analytics Pipeline are stored
in a MySQL database. Even small installations should use a different MySQL
server than the one used by the LMS. The edX Analytics Pipeline's write
patterns to the result store are more I/O intensive than usual. Placing both
databases on the same server can degrade the performance of the LMS.

=========
Scheduler
=========

Scheduling executions of the edX Analytics Pipeline can be accomplished in many
different ways. Any tool that can periodically execute shell commands should
work. The simplest tool that can perform this task is `cron`_. `Jenkins`_ is
also a good candidate.

Example Deployments
*******************

===================================
Small Scale Using Elastic MapReduce
===================================

A small deployment might consist of a single master node and a single core
node. The Scheduler is deployed to the master node and periodically executes
the edX Analytics Data Pipeline on this server. Additionally, the edX Analytics
API, edX Insights and result store are deployed to the master node. These
services run continuously. For more information, see :ref:`Using Elastic
MapReduce on AWS`.

===================================
Large Scale Using Elastic MapReduce
===================================

A large scale deployment consists of a single master node, several core nodes,
and many task nodes deployed into a public subnet of a Virtual Private Cloud.

.. image:: /Images/Analytics_AWS_Deployment.png
 :alt: Image showing all of the AWS components needed to run a large scale
       deployment of the edX analytics data pipeline.

The edX Analytics API and edX Insights are each deployed into an auto-scaling
group behind an Elastic Load Balancer which terminates SSL connections and
distributes the load among the application servers. The application servers are
deployed into a private subnet of the Virtual Private Cloud. A single virtual
server is deployed into a private subnet to host the Scheduler. The Relational
Database Service is used to deploy a MySQL server into a private subnet. The
MySQL database will be used as the result store.  For more information, see
:ref:`Using Elastic MapReduce on AWS`.

===========================================
Large Scale Without Using Elastic MapReduce
===========================================

A large deployment that does not use Elastic MapReduce requires additional
configuration steps to establish a properly configured environment. A Hadoop
cluster is deployed. The master node is considered the node that is running the
Job Tracker service for Hadoop 1.X deployments or the Resource Manager service
for Hadoop 2.X deployments. Hive and Sqoop are deployed to the master node.
Several servers are deployed outside of the Hadoop cluster that host the
remainder of the infrastructure. The edX Analytics API and edX Insights
services are each deployed to at least one server. The Scheduler is deployed to
another server. A MySQL database is deployed to a server that is configured to
host a relational database.
