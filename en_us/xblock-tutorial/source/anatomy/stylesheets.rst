This section of the tutorial walks through the CSS file, `thumbs.css`_,  that
is part of the Thumbs XBlock in the XBlock SDK.

If you completed the steps in :ref:`Build an XBlock Quick Start`, you can find
this file locally at ``xblock_development/xblock-sdk/sample_xblocks/thumbs/static/css/thumbs.css``.

In the XBlock CSS file, you define the styles that are added to the
fragment that is returned by the view method to be displayed by the runtime
application.

The styles in ``thumbs.css`` are referenced in the :ref:`XBlock HTML file <The
XBlock HTML File>`.
