The XBlock SDK is a Python application you use to help you build new XBlocks.
The XBlock SDK contains three main components:

* An XBlock creation tool that builds the skeleton of a new XBlock.
* An XBlock runtime for viewing and testing your XBlocks during development.
* Sample XBlocks that you can use as the starting point for new XBlocks, and
  for your own learning.
