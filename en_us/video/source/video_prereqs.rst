******************************
Video Processing Overview
******************************

Videos are one of the most important assets of an online course. Making
course videos available to students who are located all over the world, and
who are accessing course content with different devices and Internet
connectivity constraints, can be a complex undertaking.

* For a video to play at locations around the world, it needs to be available
  from more than one host site. 

* For a video to play on different devices, including both desktop computers
  and smart phones, it needs to be available in several different formats.

To help course teams at partner institutions meet the challenge of delivering
high quality video experiences to as many students as possible, edX offers
video file processing and media hosting services. 

* The edX media team establishes accounts for you at YouTube and Amazon Web
  Services (AWS).

* From each original video file that your course teams upload, the edX media
  team creates multiple additional formats to ensure maximum playback
  quality on different devices.

After these services are set up for your institution and course, course
teams only need to upload a single file to Studio for each of the videos they
want to include in their course. EdX completes all other processing for the
video files.

===================================
Prerequisite Tasks
===================================

Before your course teams can begin to upload videos in Studio, you work with
the edX media team to make sure that these preparatory tasks are complete.

* :ref:`Identify Video Administrators`

* :ref:`Establish Access to YouTube Account`

* :ref:`Create YouTube Channels`

When these preliminary tasks are complete, your course teams can upload
original video files in .mp4 or .mov format to Studio. An automated process
then begins to create additional formats and store them for you, ready for
students to access, with the hosting services.

.. important:: The tasks described in this section rely on the use of
 third-party tools and software. Because these tools are subject to change by
 their respective owners, the steps provided here are intended as
 guidelines and not as exact procedures.

.. _Identify Video Administrators:

****************************************
Identify Video Administrators
****************************************

Each partner institution identifies one person, or more often several
people, to be video administrators. The video administrators periodically use
the YouTube Content Management System (CMS) to access the video files that
are hosted by YouTube and the reports that YouTube produces.

In general, the video administrators use the CMS to access your YouTube
channels, the videos associated with those channels, and YouTube’s reporting
tools. In general, the CMS enables an administrator to:

* Manage ownership of files hosted on YouTube.
* Create multiple YouTube channels that are linked to your YouTube account.
* Download reports and other analytics that measure views.

Video administrators also work with members of the edX media team and course
teams to distribute information and resolve questions about video files. A
video administrator can complete these tasks.

* :ref:`Create a YouTube channel<Create YouTube Channels>` for each course. 

* :ref:`Grant management access<Add a Channel Manager>` to each YouTube
  channel to members of the corresponding course team.

EdX recommends that organizations identify specific individuals to be the
video administrators for all of your courses. By working with the edX team
over time, the video administrators can develop repeatable and consistent
procedures for managing your video assets.

.. _Establish Access to YouTube Account:

****************************************
Establish Access to YouTube Account 
****************************************

=========================================
Video Administrator Access to the Account 
=========================================

For :ref:`video administrators<Identify Video Administrators>` to use the
YouTube CMS, they must have administrative access to your CMS account.
Because access to the account is granted to email addresses, the edX media
team works with one of your video administrators to set up an email address
specifically for this purpose and give it administrative privileges.

This procedure only needs to be completed once and can be done by one of
the video administrators.

===================================
Establishing Access to the Account 
===================================

#. Create a single Google email, or Gmail, account. The recommended format
   for the account name is your edx.org member identifier followed by
   "-CMSmanager". For example, ``HarvardX-CMSmanager@gmail.com`` or ``MITx-
   CMSmanager@gmail.com``.

#. Send the email address to the edX media team at ``media@edx.org``.

   On receipt, the media team adds the Gmail address to your YouTube account
   and gives the account administrative privileges. This process results in
   an activation message that is sent to your CMSmanager Gmail account.
   Access to the CMS account is not provided until activation is complete.

3. Check the Gmail account for the activation message from YouTube. These
   messages are typically routed to the Gmail "Social" inbox.

#. To activate the account, click the "Visit the sign-up page" link in the
   email message. A browser opens to the YouTube signup page.

#. Click **Use existing Google account**. You can now access the CMS account.

All of your video administrators use the same Gmail account to log in to the
YouTube CMS. This approach helps ensure that staffing changes do not
interrupt your access to the YouTube account. Video administrators can also
create channel managers, who have limited administrative access to specific
channels in your account.

.. _Create YouTube Channels:

****************************************
Create YouTube Channels
****************************************

===============================
About YouTube Channels
===============================

For each course that your institution offers, a video administrator creates a
YouTube "channel" to store that course's video files. A channel is,
essentially, a folder or directory that stores the video files that play on
YouTube. Organizing your video files into channels by course simplifies file
delivery and management. YouTube collects analytics for each channel that you
create. YouTube also collects analytics for each channel that you create. CMS
Analytics offers reports and data that can help you evaluate channel and
video performance, including views, subscribers, watch time, and more.

.. note:: The following procedure only needs to be completed once per 
 course, but it must be complete before the course team begins to add videos
 to the course in Studio.

===============================
Creating YouTube Channels
===============================

#. In your browser, access YouTube by going to https://cms.youtube.com.

#. Use your CMSmanager Gmail address for video administrators to log in to
   the CMS account. The email address that you log in with is the owner of
   any channels that you create.

#. In the navigation bar at left, click **CHANNELS**. A list of your channels
   appears.

#. Above the list of channels click **Create New**. A popup window opens.

#. Leave the checkboxes under **Permissions** unselected, and then click
   **Continue**. (You can change the channel's permission settings at any
   time.) The popup window presents fields for information about the channel.

#. Provide a channel name that clearly and uniquely identifies the course.
   Example channel names include Water201x and Foundations of Chinese
   Thought.

#. For the category, select **Company, Institution, or Organization**.

#. Agree to the terms and then click **Done**. The list of channels now
   includes the channel that you just set up.

You can now notify the edX media team that the channel has been created. You
can also give management access to the channel to members of the
corresponding course team.

.. _Add a Channel Manager:

************************************

===============================
About Channel Managers
===============================

After video files are uploaded to Studio by a course team, an automated
process begins to complete these processes.

* Create video files in additional formats for maximum web and mobile
  delivery.

* Upload files to the designated course YouTube channel.

* Upload files to Amazon Web Services (AWS).

This process also gives each file a unique identifying name. Often, course
teams prefer to rename these files, which requires a video administrator to
change each file name in the YouTube CMS.

Video administrators can give a member of the course team management access
to a channel in a process that is similar to :ref:`establishing access to the
YouTube account<Establish Access to YouTube Account>`. To do so, they obtain
the email addresses of one or more of the course team members and then invite
them to manage the channel. Channel managers can rename or otherwise change
files only in the channels that they can access.

===============================
Adding a Channel Manager
===============================

#. In your browser, access the YouTube CMS by going to
   https://cms.youtube.com/.

#. Use your CMSmanager Gmail address for video administrators to log in to
   the CMS account. 

#. In the navigation bar at left, click **CHANNELS**. A list of your
   channels appears.

#. Click the name of the channel. The page refreshes in your browser.  

#. At top right, click the channel image. A window displays information about
   the account, including the email address that you used to log in.

   .. image:: Images/YouTube_channel_icon.png
    :alt: Icon representing the YouTube channel found at top right of the
       Channels page
   
6. Click the **YouTube settings** icon. A page with account settings opens in
   your browser.

#. On the account information page, click **Add or remove managers**. A
   list of the current channel managers appears.

#. Click **Add managers**. A popup opens.

#. Supply the email address of a course team member.

#. Verify that the **Manager** option appears at lower left.

#. Click **Invite**. An activation message is sent to the email address.

#. Advise the course team member to expect and respond to the email message
   so that the account is activated. Activation must be complete for
   management access to be granted. See steps 4-5 for :ref:`establishing
   access to a YouTube account<Establish Access to YouTube Account>`.

Course team members who complete the activation process are channel managers.
When they log in to the YouTube CMS at https://cms.youtube.com with the email
address that has channel manager privileges, they can manage course content.
