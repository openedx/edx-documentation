This is a guide to help you get started in contributing code to the Open edX
open source project. It's for people who are interested in contributing to Open
edX, but don't know what contributions would be most valuable.

Start Here!

Before we can merge your contribution, you'll need to sign a Contributor
Agreement. We suggest starting that process sooner rather than later.

    * If you are contributing as an individual, go ahead and sign the Individual
      `Contributor Agreement`_.
    * If your work will be contributed as part of a company or institution,
      email legal@tcril.org.

===================================================================================================
Should I sign the individual contributor agreement or contribute as part of an larger organization?
===================================================================================================

If you will be working on your contribution during school or work time or are
using a GitHub or email account administered by that organization, you likely
fall under our larger organization agreements. You may also be under
contractual obligation from your employer that all code you write is their
property or may be their property if written on a machine that they purchased.
If you have any questions about whether you should sign the individual
contributor agreement or contribute as part of an organization, email your
situation to legal@tcril.org and they will help find the right agreement for you.
