Some edX courses allow you to purchase academic credit that you can apply
toward a degree at a college or university. When a course offers academic
credit, you see an "Earn Credit" indication for the course in the edX list of
courses.

To earn academic credit, you must meet a series of requirements, such as
verifying your identity several times during your course or taking proctored
exams. After you meet the requirements, you can purchase academic credit for a
specific time after the course ends (usually one year).

For more information, see the following sections.

*****************************
Enroll for Academic Credit
*****************************

To receive academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track
for the course. For more information about enrolling, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling
in a Course`.

*****************************
Complete Identity Checks
*****************************

When you take a course for academic credit, you might have to complete a
number of identity checks. Identity checks include periodic identity
verification inside the course and proctored exams.

.. note:: **To be eligible for academic credit, you must complete all identity 
 checks.** If you choose not to complete an identity check at any time, you
 are no longer eligible for credit. You can still receive a verified
 certificate in the course.

========================================
In-Course Identity Verification 
========================================

When your course requires in-course identity verification, you must verify
your identity at the beginning of the course and then at certain times during
the course. For example, you might be required to verify your identity before
you take each exam.

When you must verify your identity, you receive an "Identity verification
required" message in the courseware. You cannot complete any further work in
the course until you either verify your identity or specifically decline to
verify your identity.

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

#. In the message you receive, select **Verify Now** to begin the ID
   verification process.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon below your image to
   take a picture of your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines to the right of your image.

#. On the **Review Your Photo** page, review your photo. If you are not
   satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**. When you are satisfied
   with your photo, select **Submit** in the lower left corner.

A verification confirmation page opens and confirms that you have submitted
your ID verification photo.

After edX's authorization service examines your photo, you receive a message
on your dashboard that informs you whether the verification process was
successful. If the verification process was not successful, you must submit
new verification photos. You can begin the verification process again by
selecting **Verify Your Identity**.

For more information about ID verification, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your
Identity`.

===================
Proctored Exams
===================

Proctored exams are exams that use both time limits and online proctoring
software. To pass a proctored exam, you must receive both a passing grade for
the exam itself and a Pass result when the recording of your proctoring
session is reviewed.

Before you begin a proctored exam, you must specify whether you want to take
the exam as a proctored exam. If you take the exam as a proctored exam, you
receive instructions to install the proctoring software, verify your identity,
and scan the desk and room where you are taking the exam.

If you do not take the exam as a proctored exam, the exam is still timed.
However, you are no longer eligible for credit for the course.

For more information about proctored exams, see :ref:`SFD_ProctoredExams`.

*****************************
Keep Track of Your Progress
*****************************

When you are enrolled in a course for academic credit, your **Progress** page
includes a **Requirements for Course Credit** section that lists all of the
requirements that you have to complete to be eligible for credit. This section
indicates your overall credit eligibility status and the status of each
individual requirement.

*****************************
Purchase Academic Credit
*****************************

After you meet the requirements for credit, the option to purchase academic
credit for the course appears on your dashboard below the option to download
your certificate. You also receive an email from edX. You can usually purchase
credit up to one year after the course ends.

When you purchase credit, you submit a payment to edX, and then complete any
additional steps that the specific organization that grants the credit
requires.

.. note:: More than one organization might offer credit for the same course. 
 If this is the case, you select the organization that you want when you
 purchase credit for the course.

To purchase academic credit, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, select **Purchase Credit** next to the course that you
   want.
#. On the **Checkout** page, make sure that you see the organization that you
   want to purchase credit from, and then select **Checkout** or **Checkout
   with PayPal**.

.. Yes, I know the last two instances of "Checkout" should be "Check Out".
.. Long story.

#. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the payment process. When the
   payment process is complete, a confirmation page opens, and you receive an
   email message.
#. On the payment confirmation page, note whether the organization requires
   you to complete additional steps to receive credit. If the organization has
   additional requirements, select **Complete Credit** to go to that
   organization's website.

After the organization has evaluated your information, a message on your
dashboard indicates whether the organization has granted the academic credit
for the course and provides a link to the organization. You also receive an
email that indicates whether you have received academic credit for the course.

If you do not receive credit for the course, contact the organization that
issues the credit directly.
