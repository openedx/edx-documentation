******************************
Overview of Academic Credit
******************************

Some edX courses allow you to purchase academic credit that you can apply
toward a degree at a college or university. When a course offers academic
credit, you see an "Earn Credit" indication for the course in the edX list of
courses.

To earn academic credit, you must meet a series of requirements, such as
verifying your identity several times during your course or taking proctored
exams. After you meet the requirements, you can purchase academic credit for a
specific time after the course ends (usually one year).

*****************************
Enroll for Academic Credit
*****************************

To receive academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track
for the course.

For more information about enrolling, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling in a Course`.

*****************************
Complete Identity Checks
*****************************

When you take a course for academic credit, you have to complete a
number of identity checks. Identity checks include periodic identity
reverification inside the course and proctored exams.

.. note:: **To be eligible for academic credit, you must complete all identity
 checks.** If you choose not to complete an identity check at any time, you
 are no longer eligible for credit. You can still receive a verified
 certificate in the course.

* In-course identity reverification requires you to verify your identity,
  similar to the way you verified your identity at the beginning of the
  course. You must use a computer that has a webcam to reverify your identity.

  For more information, see :ref:`SFD In Course Identity Reverification`.

* Proctored exams are exams that use both time limits and online proctoring
  software. To pass a proctored exam, you must receive both a passing grade
  for the exam itself and a Pass result when the recording of your proctoring
  session is reviewed.

  For more information about proctored exams, see :ref:`SFD_ProctoredExams`.

*****************************
Keep Track of Your Progress
*****************************

When you are enrolled in a course for academic credit, your **Progress** page
includes a **Requirements for Course Credit** section that lists all of the
requirements that you have to complete to be eligible for credit. This section
indicates your overall credit eligibility status and the status of each
individual requirement.

*****************************
Purchase Academic Credit
*****************************

After you meet the requirements for credit, the option to purchase academic
credit for the course appears on your dashboard below the option to download
your certificate. You also receive an email from edX. You can usually purchase
credit up to one year after the course ends.

When you purchase credit, you submit a payment to edX, and then complete any
additional steps that the specific organization that grants the credit
requires.

.. note:: More than one organization might offer credit for the same course.
 If this is the case, you select the organization that you want when you
 purchase credit for the course.

To purchase academic credit, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, select **Purchase Credit** next to the course that you
   want.
#. On the **Checkout** page, verify that the organization that you want to
   purchase credit from appears, and then select **Checkout** or **Checkout
   with PayPal**.

#. Follow the instructions to complete the payment process. When the payment
   process is complete, a confirmation page opens, and you receive an email
   message.

#. On the payment confirmation page, a notification informs you if the
   organization requires you to complete additional steps to receive credit.
   If the organization has additional requirements, select **Complete Credit**
   to go to that organization's website.

After the organization has evaluated your information, a message on your
dashboard indicates whether the organization has granted you academic credit
for the course and provides a link to the organization. You also receive an
email that indicates whether you have received academic credit for the course.

If you do not receive credit for the course, contact the organization that
issues the credit directly.
