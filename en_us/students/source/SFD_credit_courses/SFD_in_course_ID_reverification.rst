In-Course Identity Reverification
######################################

When your course requires in-course identity reverification, you must verify
your identity at the beginning of the course and then at certain times during
the course. For example, you might be required to verify your identity before
you take each exam.

When you must verify your identity, you receive an "Identity verification
required" message in the courseware. You cannot complete any further work in
the course until you either verify your identity or specifically decline to
verify your identity.

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

#. In the message you receive, select **Verify Now** to begin the ID
   verification process.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon below your image to
   take a picture of your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines to the right of your image.

#. On the **Review Your Photo** page, review your photo. If you are not
   satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**. When you are satisfied
   with your photo, select **Submit** in the lower left corner.

A verification confirmation page opens and confirms that you have submitted
your ID verification photo.

After edX's authorization service examines your photo, you receive a message
on your dashboard that informs you whether the verification process was
successful. If the verification process was not successful, you must submit
new verification photos. You can begin the verification process again by
selecting **Verify Your Identity**.
