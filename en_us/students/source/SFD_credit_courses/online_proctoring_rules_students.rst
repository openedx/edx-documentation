.. _Online Proctoring Rules:

####################################
Online Proctoring Rules for Learners
####################################

EdX.org uses an online proctoring service for certain exams (typically final
exams) that are part of courses that can be made eligible for credit. Students
who take proctored exams for credit are required to adhere to the following
rules to receive a **Satisfactory** result from the proctoring service.

Students should test their systems with the proctoring software well in advance
of any actual graded proctored exams in their courses, so that any
troubleshooting that is required can be accomplished. Students can take practice
proctored exams in their course, so that they can experience the steps to set up
the proctoring software as well as an example proctored exam.

As with other ID-verified assessments and exams, students will be asked to
establish their identity during the proctored exam process by supplying a
government-issued photo ID with a full name that matches the name they used to
register on edX.org.


*****************************
Test Environment Requirements
*****************************

To pass a proctored exam, students must make sure that the environment in
which they take the exam meets the following requirements.

=====================================
The Room You are Taking the Test In
=====================================

   enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred.
   If overhead lighting is not available, the source of light should not be
   behind you.

#. Sit at a clean desk or table, not on a bed or couch.

#. Clear the desk or table of all materials such as books, papers, notebooks,
   calculators, and so on, unless you have been specifically permitted (in
   posted guidelines) to have such materials available for a particular
   examination.

following tools should not be on your desk or used during your proctored exam.

   computer on which you are taking the exam.
