******************************
Overview of Online Proctoring
******************************

EdX.org uses an online proctoring service for certain exams (typically final
exams) that are part of courses that can be made eligible for credit. Learners
taking proctored exams are required to adhere to a set of defined rules to
receive a **Satisfactory** result from the proctoring service.

If a particular exam in your course has less stringent rules or allows you to
use a specific tool such as a calculator or reference book during a proctored
exam, your course staff will let you know. If you are not told about any
different proctoring exam rules, make sure you adhere to the "Closed Book
Exam" rules that are described in the following sections.

Students are responsible for testing their systems with the proctoring
software well in advance of all online proctored exams in their courses, so
that any troubleshooting that is required can be accomplished. Students might
be able to take practice proctored exams in their course, or can refer to the
free Demo Course on edX.org, where they can experience a sample proctored
exam.

As with other ID-verified assessments and exams, learners will be asked to
establish their identity during the proctored exam process by supplying a
government-issued photo ID with a full name that matches the name they used to
register on edX.org.

.. note:: If you require additional time or any specific accommodations or
   exemptions to the exam policies in order to complete a proctored exam,
   contact your instructor or edX Support.


*****************************
Test Environment Requirements
*****************************

To pass a proctored exam, learners must make sure that the environment in
which they take the exam meets the following requirements.

=====================================
The Room You are Taking the Test In
=====================================

#. Make sure the room is well lit. The lighting in the room must be bright
   enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred.
   If overhead lighting is not available, the source of light should not be
   behind you.

#. Sit at a clean desk or table, not on a bed or couch.

#. Clear the desk or table of all materials such as books, papers, notebooks,
   calculators, and so on, unless you have been specifically permitted (in
   posted guidelines) to have such materials available for a particular
   examination.

   In addition to pens, paper, calculators, textbooks, and notebooks, the
   following tools should not be on your desk or used during your proctored
   exam.

 * Phones.
 * Programs such as Excel, Word, Powerpoint.
 * Any website other than edX.org.
 * Communication programs such as Skype.

#. Make sure there is no writing visible on the desk or on the walls around
   you.

#. Make sure you do not have more than one display or monitor connected to the
   computer on which you are taking the exam.

#. Do not have music or television playing in the background during the exam.

#. Do not use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of listening equipment.

#. Do not talk to anyone else. During the proctored exam you must not
   communicate with any other person by any means.

#. Do not use a phone for any reason during the proctored exam.

#. While you are taking the proctored exam, no other person is allowed to
   enter the room in which you are taking the exam.

#. The room you take the exam in must be the same room in which you performed
   the room scan during the proctoring session setup.

#. Do not leave the room during the exam for any reason, unless you have been
   specifically permitted to do so in posted guidelines for a particular exam.

#. Do not move to another room during the exam. The exam must be completed in
   the same room that the proctoring webcam scan is performed in.

==========================================
The Computer You are Taking the Test With
==========================================

#. Make sure you do not have more than one display or monitor connected to the
   computer on which you are taking the exam. For example, if you usually use
   a laptop with a monitor connected, disconnect your monitor and use only the
   laptop screen.

#. Before starting your proctored exam, close all other programs or windows on
   your testing computer.

#. The following tools should not be during your proctored exam.

 * Programs such as Excel, Word, Powerpoint.
 * Any website other than edX.org.
 * Communication programs such as Skype.

==========================================
Your Personal Behavior
==========================================

#. Dress as if you are in a public setting.

#. Do not leave the room during the exam for any reason, unless you have been
   specifically permitted to do so in posted guidelines for a particular exam.

#. Do not move to another room during the exam. The exam must be completed in
   the same room that the proctoring webcam scan is performed in.

#. Do not have music or television playing in the background.

#. Do not use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of listening equipment.

#. Do not talk to anyone else. During the proctored exam you must not
   communicate with any other person by any means.

   enter the room in which you are taking the exam.

Consequences of Violating the Policy
************************************

If you violate the online proctoring rules in a way that results in your
proctoring session being given an **Unsatisfactory** status, you are not
eligible to use the course for academic credit, even if you have achieved a
passing grade.

If you have questions about your proctoring exam status, go to http://edx.org
to contact edX Support, or consult your course team.
