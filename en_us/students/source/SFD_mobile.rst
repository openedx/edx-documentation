The edX Mobile App
########################

The edX mobile app is a companion to the `edx.org`_ website. You can use the
app to download course videos so that you can watch them whenever you want to,
without an Internet connection. To access the rest of the course, including
the course discussions and the homework and quizzes, you use a web browser on
your desktop computer.

The edX mobile app is currently available for Android smartphones and iPhones.

Courseware Questions
*************************

========================================================
Can I take a course entirely on my mobile device?

Not at this time. With the edX mobile app, you can download course videos to
watch when you do not have an Internet connection. To complete other work,
including readings, homework problems, and exams, use a desktop computer.

========================================================
How do I post questions on the discussion board?
========================================================

Right now, you cannot use the app to participate in course discussions. To

Video Questions
*************************

================================
How do I download videos?
================================

To download videos, select the download icon that appears to the right of each
section, subsection, or video name. If you select the download icon for a
video, you download just that video. If you select the download icon for a
section or subsection, you download all of the videos in that section or
subsection.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_DownloadIcon.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the download icon circled

To download videos, you must be connected to the Internet. After you download
a file, you can watch it any time.

================================================
How much data will the videos in this app use?
================================================

Course videos are optimized for mobile playback, but watching or downloading any
video can result in heavy data use. We recommend using a Wi-Fi connection if you
intend to watch or download a lot of videos. The edX app has a **Download only
on Wi-Fi** setting that is enabled by default to help you avoid using your
cellular network accidentally.

========================================================================
What are the numbers to the right of section and subsection names?
========================================================================

The number to the right of a section or subsection name is the number of videos
in that section or subsection.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_NumberVideos.png
   :width: 300
   :alt: List of sections with the number of videos circled

========================================================
What are the circles to the left of the video name?
========================================================

The circle indicates whether you have already played a video. A blue circle
means that you have not started playing the video. A half-filled circle means
that you played part of the video. A gray circle means that you played the
entire video.

========================================
How can I make the video full screen?
========================================

Rotate your phone until the video changes to landscape, or select the full
screen icon in the bottom right corner of the video screen.

.. image:: /Images/Mob_FullScreenIcon.png

   :alt: Video in windowed mode with full screen icon circled

==================================
How can I see captions?
==================================

While a video plays, select the gear icon in the lower-right corner, and then
select **Closed Captions**. If the video has captions, a list of the languages
that are available appears. Select the language that you want in the list.

.. how do I change to a different language? to come here DOC-1780
.. Some captions are available in just one language, and others are available in several languages. 

==================================
Can I speed up the videos?
==================================

You can change video speeds on the iPhone app.

On the Android app, videos currently run only in their original speeds. We are
working on the ability to change video speeds.

   then select the option's current setting to change it.

.. note:: By default, the app is set so that it will only download content,

  you may exceed the data allowance for your cellular plan.
