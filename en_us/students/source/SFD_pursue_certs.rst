.. _SFD Change to the Verified Track:

********************************
Upgrading to the Verified Track
********************************

If you enroll in the audit track for a course on the edx.org website, and then
decide to pursue a verified certificate, you can upgrade to the verified track
until enrollment for verified certificates ends for the course. Enrollment in
the verified track usually ends two or more weeks after the course start date.

To find out the deadline for enrolling in or upgrading to the verified track
for a course, follow these steps.

#. On the edx.org website, select your public edX username in the top corner of

     certificate or the verification deadline has passed.

.. nice to have: either make this ^^ "ID Verification Deadline" or "Certificate Upgrade Deadline" (or have two sections). It's pretty confusing right now. - AHodges 28 Oct 16

.. _SFD Verify Your Identity:

******************************
Verifying Your Identity
******************************

When you enroll in the :ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` for a course,
you must use a webcam to take a photograph of yourself and of a
government-issued photo ID. You do not have to verify your identity
immediately, but you must verify your identity before the course ID
verification deadline. The deadline appears below the name of the course on
your dashboard.

To verify your identity, you use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of
a government-issued photo ID to edX's authorization service. EdX encrypts your
photos and uses the highest levels of security available to protect your data.

When you verify your identity for an edX course, that verification is effective
for one year.

* If you enroll in the verified track for another course, you must verify your
  identity for that course separately.

* If you enroll in a course that offers academic credit, you might have to
  verify your identity periodically during the course. For more information,
  see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

===================================
Preparing to Verify Your Identity
===================================

When you enroll in the verified track for a course, you must use a webcam to
take a photograph of yourself and of a government-issued photo ID. Before you
begin the identity verification process, follow these recommendations to make
the process as straightforward as possible.

* Make sure that you have access to a webcam.

  If your computer does not have a webcam, edX recommends that you find out if
  your local library has a webcam that you can use, or that you borrow a
  friend's webcam. If you have a smartphone that has a camera, you can also
  verify your identity by visiting the following page in the smartphone's
  browser.

  https://courses.edx.org/verify_student/reverify

  You can sign in to one computer or smartphone to verify your identity, and
  then sign in to the computer that you typically use to complete the course.
  If you do not use a webcam to verify your identity, you cannot receive a
  verified certificate.

* Compare the way that your name appears when you sign in to edx.org to the way
  it appears on your ID card. Your name must be the same for both, including
  the type of characters used (Roman or non-Roman), accented characters,
  initials, and spelling.

  You can update your edX account name at any time on the edX :ref:`account
  settings page<SFD Update Account Settings>`. You also have the opportunity to
  change your edX account name during the identity verification process.

* Make sure that your identification card is government issued, such as a
  driver's license or passport.

* Make sure that your name is legible, and that your name and photo are visible
  together on a single image.

  If your name and your photo are on two different pages, or on the front and
  back of a single page, you can copy both pages onto a single piece of paper.
  Make sure that your name is legible in the copy.

* Make sure that you can adjust the lighting for the photographs.

  For the webcam to focus, there needs to be enough light on your face and your
  ID. You might need to change the position or brightness of a lamp, or change
  your position, to improve the lighting for the photographs.

=========================
Verify Your Identity
=========================

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

#. Make sure that you have a webcam and a government-issued photo ID available.

#. Start the verification process by completing one of the following actions.

   * If you have not yet enrolled in the course, :ref:`enroll in the verified
     track<Enroll in the Verified Track>`, submit your payment information, and
     then select **Verify Now** on the payment confirmation page.

   * If you enrolled in the audit track of the course, :ref:`upgrade to the
     verified track<Upgrade to the Verified Track>`.

   * If you enrolled in the verified track and submitted payment but you have
     not yet verified your identity, on your dashboard of courses select
     **Verify Now** next to the course.

#. At the top of your browser window, a message asks you to share the camera
   with edx.org. To see and respond to this message every time you take or
   retake a photograph for the verification process, select **Share Selected
   Device**. To share the webcam throughout the process select **Always
   Share**.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon to take a photo of
   your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines beside your image.

#. Review your photo to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the available
   space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Take a photo of your
     ID**.

#. On the **Take a Photo of Your ID** page, hold your government-issued photo
   ID up to the webcam on your computer. Make sure that the image of your ID is
   legible, and then select the camera icon to take a photo of your ID.

#. Review the photo of your ID to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the
   available space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Review your
     Info**.

#. On the **Review Your Photos** page, review the photos of your face and of
   your ID. Make sure that the photos meet all of the requirements listed under
   **Photo requirements**.

   If the name on your ID is different from your edX account name, select
   **Edit Your Name**. You must edit your edX account name to exactly match the
   name on your ID.

      :alt: The Review Your Photos page with a photo of an ID with non-Roman
        characters and a callout indicating where the learner enters his full
        name.

   For example, if your ID shows your name in Chinese characters, but your edX
   account name appears in Roman characters, you must update your edX account
   name to match the name on your ID.

#. After you make sure that your photos meet all of the requirements listed
   under **Photo requirements** select **Confirm**.

   A message confirms that you have submitted your photos.

After edX's authorization service examines your photos, a message on your
dashboard informs you whether the verification process was successful. If the
verification process was not successful, you must submit new verification
photos. You can begin the verification process again by selecting **Verify Your
Identity**.


=====================================
Check Your ID Verification Status
=====================================

If you have enrolled in the verified certificate track for a course, your
dashboard provides the status of your ID verification.

On your dashboard, locate the course.

Your ID verification status appears with the course image for that course.
For more information, see :ref:`learners:SFD Verify Your Identity`.


==================================================
Troubleshooting the Identity Verification Process
==================================================

If you have a problem during the identity verification process, these
suggestions might help you find a resolution.

* Make sure that you are using a :ref:`supported browser<learners:Browsers>`.

  You can also switch from one browser, such as Internet Explorer or Safari, to
  another browser, such as Firefox or Chrome.

* To take photographs, the webcam uses `Adobe Flash Player`_. You might need to
  install this application or update to the latest version.
