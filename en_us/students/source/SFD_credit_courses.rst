Some edX courses allow you to purchase academic credit that you can apply
toward a degree at a college or university. When a course offers academic
credit, you see an "Earn Credit" indication for the course in the edX list of
courses.

To earn academic credit, you must meet a series of requirements, such as
verifying your identity several times during your course or taking proctored
exams. After you meet the requirements, you can purchase academic credit for a
specific time after the course ends (usually one year).

*****************************
Enroll for Academic Credit
*****************************

To receive academic credit for a course, you must enroll in the verified track
for the course. For more information about enrolling, see :ref:`SFD Enrolling
in a Course`.

When you take a course for academic credit, you might have to complete a
number of identity checks. You must complete all of the identity checks in the
course to be eligible for credit. Identity checks include periodic identity
verification and proctored exams.

========================================
Identity Verification 
========================================

When you take a course for academic credit, you must verify your identity both
at the beginning of the course and at certain times during the course. For
example, you may be required to verify your identity before you take each
exam.

.. note:: To be eligible for academic credit, you must verify your identity 
 every time that you receive a request to verify your identity. If you choose
 not to verify your identity at any time, you are no longer eligible for
 credit. You can still receive a verified certificate in the course.

When you must verify your identity, you receive a message in the
courseware. Select **Verify Now** to begin the ID verification process. 

To verify your identity during the course, you must take a photo of your face,
the same way you did at the beginning of the course. You do not have to take a
photo of your ID again.

For more information about ID verification, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your
Identity`.

For more information about verified certificates, see :ref:`SFD Verified
Certificates`.

*****************************
Purchase Academic Credit
*****************************

After you meet the requirements for credit, the option to purchase academic
credit for the course appears on your dashboard below the option to download
your certificate. You also receive an email from edX.

When you purchase credit, you submit a payment to edX, and then complete any
additional steps that the specific organization that grants the credit
requires.

.. note:: More than one organization might offer credit for the same course. 
 If this is the case, you select the organization that you want when you
 purchase credit for the course.

To purchase academic credit, follow these steps.

#. On your dashboard, select **Purchase Credit** next to the course that you
   want.
#. On the **Checkout** page, select the organization that you want to purchase
   credit from (if applicable), and then select **Check Out** or **Check Out
   with PayPal**.
#. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the payment process. When the
   payment process is complete, a confirmation page opens, and you receive an
   email message.
#. On the payment confirmation page, note whether the organization requires
   you to complete additional steps to receive credit. If the organization has
   additional requirements, select **Complete Credit** to go to that
   organization's website.

After the organization has evaluated your information, a message on your
dashboard indicates whether the organization has granted the academic credit
for the course and provides a link to the organization. You also receive an
email that indicates whether you have received academic credit for the course.

If you do not receive credit for the course, contact the organization that
issues the credit directly.
