Welcome to edX! We're glad you're taking a course with us and we hope you're as 
excited as we are about online learning.

A Note about Time Zones 
************************

As you work through your course, you'll see dates and times when new materials 
are released and when homework assignments and exams are due. It's important to 
remember that edX lists all times in universal coordinated time (UTC). 
When you see a time in your course, we recommend that you use a time zone converter 
to convert the UTC time to your local time. You can any converter that you want, 
including one of the following time zone converters.

`Time and Date Time Zone Converter <http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html>`_
