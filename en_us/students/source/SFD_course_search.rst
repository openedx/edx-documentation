Searching the Course
#####################

Much of the content of your edX course is searchable, including course text and
video transcripts. To search your edX course content, go to the **Courseware**
tab, and then enter a search term in the **Search** field in the upper-left
corner of the page. Your search term can contain more than one word.

After you enter your search term, your search results appear in the right
pane. The search results include your search term, a brief excerpt from the
surrounding text, and the place in the course where the search term appears. To
view your search term in the body of the course, click **View** to the right of
the search result.

Many searches return your search term and similar terms. For example, a search
for "grade" returns results for "grades" and "graded".

.. note:: You cannot use the **Search** field on the **Courseware** tab to 
 search course discussions. To search course discussions, use the **Search all
 posts** field on the **Discussions** tab. For more information, see
 :ref:`Course Discussions Index`.

 Course exercises and problems, including homework and exam problems, are not
 currently searchable.
