The edX Video Player
#####################

All edX courses include videos, and edX has its own video player. Most of the
controls on the player will be familiar to you if you have watched online videos
before. However, the edX video player has some extra features you may not have 
seen.

The following image shows the video player in the middle of a video, followed by
an explanation of each option or control on the video player.

1. **Play/pause control**: You can play or pause the video by using this control.
2. **Time**: The first number indicates the time the video has played. The second
   number indicates the total length of the video.
3. **Time slider**: You can drag this control to any point in the video if you want
   to go back or skip ahead to a particular time.
4. **Speed control**: If you want the video to play faster or slower, you can select
   different speeds using this control.
5. **Volume control**: You can use this control to change the volume of the video.
6. **Full screen control**: You can expand the video to fill your browser window by
   selecting this control. To return to default mode, press ESC on your
   keyboard.
7. **HD control**: Some videos have a high-definition option that you can use if
   you have a fast internet connection. You only see this control if your video
   has a high-definition option.
8. **Show transcript control**: You can show or hide the scrolling transcript to the
   right of the video by selecting this control. 
9. **Download video option**: This option allows you to download the video to
   watch later. You only see this option if the video is available for download.
10. **Download transcript option**: This option allows you to download a copy of
    the video's transcript. You can download the transcript as a SubRip (.srt)
    file or as a text (.txt) file. You can open files of both types in a text
    editor such as Notepad. You only see this option if the transcript is
    available for download.
11. **Transcript**: The transcript for the video plays by default when your
    video starts. You can scroll through the transcript and click on any word to
    go to that point in the video.
