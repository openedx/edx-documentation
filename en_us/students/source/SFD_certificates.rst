Receiving Your edX Certificate
###############################

.. The Open edX Learner's Guide also includes a Certificates topic, but it has
.. no shared content with this topic and there is no "Certificates" file in the
.. Shared folder.

EdX awards certificates for courses that have a verified track and for edX
programs such as XSeries and MicroMasters programs. Most certificates are web
certificates that you can save, share, and print.

To receive a certificate for an edX course, you enroll in the :ref:`verified
track<SFD Verified Track>` for the course, pay the certificate fee,
:ref:`verify your identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` with a webcam and a
government-issued ID, and earn a passing grade.

To receive a certificate for a program, you must receive a verified certificate
for each course in the series of courses that make up the program. Some
programs might have additional requirements.

This section describes edX certificates and how you access them.

    Some edX courses offer academic credit. If you are taking a course for
    academic credit, different requirements and steps for earning certificates
    apply. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit Index`.

  In the past, edX also offered free honor code certificates. These
  certificates are no longer available for most new courses. If you earned an
  honor code certificate in a previous course, you can still access your
  certificate through your :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner Dashboard>`.

  For more information, see `News About edX Certificates`_.

.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

==============================
About Verified Certificates
==============================

A verified certificate shows not only that you successfully completed your edX
course, but also that you :ref:`verified your identity<SFD Verify Your
Identity>` by using a webcam and an official government-issued photo ID.

Verified certificates include the following information.

* The name that you entered as your full name when you created your account.

  To verify or change your full name before the course ends, check your account

.. note::

  Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course or the
  number of credit hours that a university might offer for the course. Your
  final grade appears on your **Progress** page and on your dashboard. If you
  need a record of your grade, you can print your **Progress** page or
  dashboard.

For more information about enrolling in the verified track for a course and
working toward a verified certificate, see :ref:`Enroll in the Verified Track`.

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates for instructor-paced courses and for many self-paced courses are
distributed automatically after a course or program ends. In this case, you do
not have to complete any additional steps to receive your certificate.

In an instructor-paced course, the course team sets specific due dates for
assignments and exams, and you complete the course within a defined time
period, such as eight or twelve weeks.

In a self-paced course, assignments and exams do not have due dates. You can
complete assignments and exams at your own pace, as long as you complete all
course work before the course ends.

====================================================
Receive a Certificate for an Instructor-Paced Course
====================================================

Most courses distribute certificates within two weeks after the course ends.

When your certificate is ready, a link to your certificate is visible on your
dashboard, along with your final grade.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_web.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: Dashboard with course name, grade, and link to the certificate.

Select **View Certificate** to open the certificate in your browser. You can
then share and print the certificate. For more information, see :ref:`SFD
Sharing or Printing a Certificate`.

.. note::
  As of September 2015, edX verified certificates are web certificates. If you
  completed a course before September 2015, the certificate is in PDF format.
  Instead of a **View Certificate** option, you see a **Download Certificate
  (PDF)** option for these certificates.

If your certificate is not yet ready, you see the following message under the
course name on your dashboard.

::

  Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
  will be available shortly.

Additionally, you see the following status message on the **Progress** page in
your course.

::

  We're working on it...

  We're creating your certificate. You can keep working in your courses and a
  link to it will appear here and on your Dashboard when it is ready.

.. _Receive a Certificate for a Self Paced Course:

=============================================
Receive a Certificate for a Self-Paced Course
=============================================

While many edX courses have specific start and end dates, some courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses at any time and work through them at
your own pace.

Most self-paced courses offer edX-generated certificates. A few self-paced
courses offer on-demand certificates.

EdX-Generated Certificates
**************************

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for an instructor-paced course. After you have completed all course
requirements, a certificate is generated automatically. You do not have to
complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others
issue certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
specific certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Home** page
for your course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates:

On-Demand Certificates
**********************

Some self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to request and download your certificate as soon as you complete
enough of the course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out
if a course offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

::

  Congratulations, you've qualified for a certificate!

  You can keep working toward a higher grade in the course, or request your
  certificate now.

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate.

.. Caution::
 The grade that you see on your dashboard reflects your grade at that time you
 requested the certificate. If you complete more assignments to raise your
 grade, the grade on your **Progress** page changes, but the grade listed on
 your dashboard is not updated.

.. _Receive an On Demand Certificate:

To receive and download your certificate at any time after you qualify, follow
these steps.
