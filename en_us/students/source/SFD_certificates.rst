证书
##############################

几乎所有在edx.org上的课程都会在你完成学时后提供一份证书，包含你的姓名、课程名、课程所属大学、授课团队的成员姓名，以及一条链接以供其他人来查验这份证书的授权。

因为edX课程不是学分制的，所以证书并不包含像大学课程那样明确的成绩或学习时间。此外，edX课程的成绩单也是无法获得的。

.. note:: 证书列出了你在仪表盘上显示的全名。在课程结束之前，请确保仪表盘上的名字是正确的。如果要更改你的全名，请访问仪表盘，然后选择左侧栏中的 **全名** 下的 **编辑** 一项。

****************************
选择一个证书的种类
****************************

有三种证书可在edx.org上获得：荣誉证书，认证证书，以及XSeries。当注册一门课程的时候你可以选择想要的证书种类。

荣誉证书以及认证证书表明了你已经完成一项荣誉课程或者认证课程。如其所述，一张XSeries证书表明了你已经完成一系列的课程。

证书的种类将会在仪表盘上的课程简图下用不同颜色的标签注明：

.. note:: 有极少数的课程不提供证书，它们和edX的其他课程一样属于可信来源。如果想要证明你已完成这门课程，可以打印课程中的 **进度** 一页。


=========================
荣誉证书
=========================

荣誉证书对于所有学生免费，并且除个别几个特殊要求的课程外，所有课程都可获取。当你旁听了一门课程，或加入了一门不提供verified证书的时候，你将自动获得一份荣誉证书，前提是你通过了课程的所有考核。

=========================
认证证书
=========================

一份认证证书表明你不仅成功地完成了你的edX课程，而且你已通过网络摄像头和身份证号的方式获取所在国家或地区的认证。如果你计划将课程用于职位申请、升职或学校申请的话，那么你可以努力获取一份认证证书。

   :alt: Example edX honor code certificate

认证证书均可在精品课程中获取。如果一门课程提供认证证书的话，那么你可以在edx.org的课程列表中看到课程简图下的“认证”标志。

认证证书可在不同收费下的课程中获得，这些费用将帮助edX的建设。如果你希望资助edX的话，那么你可以通过支付比最少费用更多的钱来这么做。关于某门课程收费方面的信息，请参阅这门课程的介绍页面。

当注册一门认证课程时，你会被要求用网络摄像头拍摄一张自拍照，并附上身份证号，提交至edX安全认证服务。我们将会加密你的照片并用最高等级的安全措施来保护你的数据。当课程进行时，你或许会被要求用同样的方式再次认证你之前的身份信息。如果你的计算机没有网络摄像头的话，那么你必须用有摄像头的计算机来注册并获取认证证书。

.. 关于更多注册认证证书、费用支付的信息请参阅：ref:`SFD_registration`. (这篇章节还不存在！)

若希望获知所有提供认证证书的课程，请参阅 `edX课程目录 <https://www.edx.org/course-
list/allschools/verified/allcourses>`_.

如果你对认证证书的计费有任何问题或意见，请联系我们： `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. 请在邮件中写明你的订单号，但 **不要写你的信用卡信息**。

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you've successfully earned a verified certificate
for each course in a series of courses that make up an XSeries.

****************************
Changing a Certificate Type
****************************

You may register for one type of certificate but later decide that you want a
different type of certificate. For example, you may register for an honor code
certificate, but you might later want to change to a verified certificate. You
can change the certificate type until registration for verified certificates
ends for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course starts.

* To upgrade to a verified certificate, go to your dashboard, and then select
  **Challenge Yourself!** under the name of your course. You'll then follow the
  onscreen instructions to register for a verified certificate.

  If registration for verified certificates has closed, you can't change your
  certificate type. Registration for verified certificates typically closes two
  weeks after the course has started, or after at least one assignment due date
  has passed.

* To change from a verified certificate to an honor code certificate, go to your
  dashboard, and then select **Unregister** under the name of your course. The
  edX support team will contact you with information about a refund. You must
  change to an honor code certificate before verified certificate registration
  closes for your course if you want to receive a refund.

  If you don't see the **Unregister** button, registration for verified
  certificates has closed. Registration for verified certificates typically
  closes two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one
  assignment due date has passed. 

If you have questions about changing your certificate type, you can contact the
edX support team at `technical@edx.org <mailto://technical@edx.org>`_. 

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends--usually within two
weeks. After the course ends, you'll see the following message under the course
name on your dashboard:

``Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
will be available shortly.``

When your certificate is ready, your dashboard will show you your final grade
for the class as well as a link to your certificate.

If you want a paper copy of your certificate, you can select **Download Your Certificate (PDF)** to download and print the certificate from your dashboard.

.. note:: Your certificate lists the full name that appears on your dashboard. 
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is correct. 
  To change your full name, go to your dashboard, and then select **edit** under 
  **Full Name** in the left pane.

=============================================
Receiving Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
=============================================

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through the courseware
at your own pace.

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you've completed all course assignments
and the final exam (if applicable), a certificate is generated automatically.
You don't have to complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others issue
certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's specific
certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Course Info** tab for your
course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates: 

On-Demand Certificates
*********************************

A few self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to request and download your certificate as soon as you complete
enough of the course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out
if a course offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

.. image:: /Images/SFD_Cert_QualifiedOnDemand.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: Image of the top of a Progress page, with the text "Congratulations,
      you've qualified for a certificate!"

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate. Note, however, that if you request your certificate before the
end of the course, the grade that you see on your dashboard no longer updates
automatically as you complete coursework. Your **Progress** page continues to
reflect your current grade. To update your grade on your dashboard, request
your certificate again.

.. note:: Your course grade does not appear on your certificate.


.. _Request Download Certificate:

Request and Download a Certificate
====================================

To receive your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate, follow these steps.

#. On the course **Progress** page, select **Request Certificate**.

   The certificate creation process may take up to 48 hours. After your
   certificate has been created, you see the following message on your
   **Progress** page.

   .. image:: /Images/SFD_Certs_CertificateAvailable.png
    :width: 500
    :alt: Image of a message with the following text: "Your certificate is
        available. You can now download your certificate as a PDF here or on
        your dashboard."

#. Download your certificate from the **Progress** page or from your dashboard.

   * To download your certificate from the **Progress** page, select
     **Download Your Certificate** in the upper right corner of the page.

   * To download your certificate from your dashboard, select **Download Your
     Certificate** next to the name of your course.

Update Your Certificate
========================

If you want to update your certificate with a different name or an improved
grade, click **Update Certificate** on either your **Progress** page or
your dashboard to request and download a new certificate. If you want to
change the name on the certificate, make sure that you change your full name
on the **Account Settings** page before you request the new certificate.
