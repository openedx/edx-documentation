Overview
**********

When you enroll in an edX course, you automatically enroll in the audit track
for that course. All courses offer an audit track. The audit track is free of
charge, and offers you access to all course materials, including assignments
and exams. The audit track does not include a certificate for learners who
successfully complete the course.

In addition to the audit track, many courses offer a verified certificate
track. This track awards verified certificates to learners who successfully
complete the course and verify their identities. Verified certificates carry a
fee that varies by course. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Verified
Certificates`.

EdX also offers XSeries certificates for learners who complete an XSeries
program. For more information, see :ref:`SFD XSeries Certificates`.

Transcripts are not available for edX course work.

.. note::
    Some edX courses offer academic credit. These courses have different
    requirements and steps for earning certificates. For more information, see
    :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit Index`.

.. _SFD Certificate Types:

****************************
Certificate Types
****************************

EdX offers two types of certificates: a verified certificate for a single
course, or an XSeries certificate for a series of courses. Not all courses
offer certificates.

.. note::

  In the past, edX also offered free honor code certificates. These
  certificates are no longer available for most new courses. If you earned an
  honor code certificate in a previous course, you still have access to your
  certificate through your dashboard.

  For more information, see `News About edX Certificates`_.

.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

======================
Verified Certificates
======================

A verified certificate shows not only that you successfully completed your edX
course, but also that you have verified your identity by using a webcam and an
official government-issued photo ID from your country or region. You might want
to work toward a verified certificate if you plan to use your course for job
applications, promotions, or school applications.

A verified certificate includes your name, the name of the course, the edX
partner institution that created the course, and the names and signatures of
one or more members of the course team. The certificate does not include your
final grade in the course or the number of credit hours that the course might
earn at a university.

.. note::
  The name on the certificate is the full name that appears on your dashboard.
  Before your course ends, make sure that the name on your dashboard is
  correct. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Basic Information`.

If a course offers verified certificates, you see a "Verified" badge on the
course image in the list of courses on edx.org.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_VerifiedBadge.png

   :alt: Image of DemoX course listing with a verified badge

For a list of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX
course catalog`_.

Verified certificates are available for a fee that varies by course. The
fee helps support edX. If you want to donate to edX, you can choose to pay
more than the minimum required fee. For more information about the fee for
a particular course, see the About page for that course.

When you enroll in the verified certificate track for a course, you must
submit a payment before you can see course content. You do not have to
verify your identity at that time. However, you must verify your identity
before the deadline for verification in that course. For more information,
see :ref:`SFD Verify Your Identity`.

.. note:: When you verify your identity for one course, you verify your
 identity for all edX courses. Verification is effective for one year. If
 you enroll in another verified course within that year, you do not have to
 verify your identity again.

After you submit a payment for a verified certificate, you can view that
payment at any time. For more information, see :ref:`View Order History`.

If you have a question or an issue with billing for a verified certificate,
contact edX at `billing@edx.org <mailto://billing@edx.org>`_. Include your
order number, but please **do not include your credit card information**.

For more information about verified certificates, see `Verified Certificates`_
on edx.org.

.. _SFD XSeries Certificates:

=========================
XSeries Certificates
=========================

XSeries certificates show that you have successfully earned a verified
certificate for each course in a series of courses that make up an XSeries
program. An XSeries program can have from three to ten individual courses.

If a course is part of an XSeries program, you see an "XSeries Program"
badge on the course image in the list of courses on edx.org.

For more information about XSeries programs, see `XSeries Programs`_ on
edx.org.

For a list of all courses that are part of an XSeries program, see the `edX
course catalog`_.

*************************
Receiving a Certificate
*************************

Certificates are distributed shortly after a course ends, usually within two
weeks. After the course ends, you see the following message under the
course name on your dashboard.

::

  Final course details are being wrapped up at this time. Your final standing
  will be available shortly.

When your certificate is ready, your dashboard shows your final grade as well
as a link to your certificate. You can access either a web or PDF certificate.


.. the following Web Certificates topic and its subtopics were copied and then pasted into the Open edX learner's SFD_certificates.rst for Dogwood. 10 Feb 16, A Hodges, no time to do this right.

==================
Web Certificates
==================

Newer edX courses issue web-based certificates. You access your web-based
certificate from your dashboard.

The following example shows the link to a certificate in the dashboard.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_web.png

   :alt: Dashboard with course name, grade, and link to the web certificate.

Select **View Certificate** to open the certificate in your browser. You can
then share and print the certificate.

Share Your Web Certificates
*****************************

You can share your web certificates on Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

Ensure you are logged in to the social site on which you want to share your
certificate.

Select the social icons at the top of each certificate.

A dialog box for the social site you selected opens, with the certificate URL
entered. Complete the steps for the social site to post your certificate.

.. _Print a Web Certificate:

Print a Web Certificate
*****************************

To print a web certificate, open the certificate and select **Print
Certificate** in the certificate header.

To print your certificate in the most professional looking format, follow these
guidelines.

* Do not print the header or footer. Depending on your system, you might need
  to clear this option.

* Set the margins to the minimum space available. Depending on your system, you
  might need to select the **Minimum** option for the margins.

===================
PDF Certificates
===================


Older edX courses issued PDF certificates. You can access your PDF certificates
from the your dashboard.

The following example shows the link to an honor code certificate in the
dashboard.

You can share your PDF certificate on LinkedIn.

Select **Add to profile** beneath the course in your dashboard.

Your profile page in LinkedIn opens, with a prompt to confirm the addition of
your certificate.

***********************************
Certificates for Self-Paced Courses
***********************************

While most edX courses have specific start and end dates, a few courses are
self-paced. You can start these courses anytime and work through them at your
own pace.

Receiving a certificate for a self-paced course is similar to receiving a
certificate for a regular course. After you have completed all course
requirements, a certificate is generated automatically. You do not have to
complete any additional steps to obtain your certificate.

Be aware, however, that different self-paced courses issue certificates at
different intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others
issue certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
specific certificate schedule, see the About page or the **Home** page
for your course.

.. _SFD On Demand Certificates:

======================
On-Demand Certificates
======================

Some self-paced courses offer on-demand certificates. These certificates
allow you to request and download your certificate as soon as you complete
enough of the course with a high enough grade to qualify for a certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course. You can usually find out
if a course offers on-demand certificates on the course About page.

If a course offers on-demand certificates, as soon as you have qualified for a
certificate, you see the following message at the top of the course
**Progress** page.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_QualifiedOnDemand.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Image of the top of a Progress page, with the text "Congratulations,
      you qualified for a certificate!"

You can request your certificate at any time after you have qualified for the
certificate.

.. Caution::
 The grade that you see on your dashboard reflects your grade at that time you
 requested the certificate. If you complete more assignments to raise your
 grade, the grade on your **Progress** page changes, but the grade listed on
 your dashboard is not updated.

.. _Request Download Certificate:

====================================
Request and Download a Certificate
====================================

To receive your certificate at any time after you qualify, follow these steps.

#. On the course **Progress** page, select **Request Certificate**.

   After you request your certificate, the certificate creation process may
   take up to 48 hours. When your certificate is ready, a "Your certificate is
   available" message appears on your **Progress** page.

#. Download your certificate from the **Progress** page or from your dashboard.

   * To download your certificate from the **Progress** page, select
     **Download Your Certificate** in the upper right corner of the page.

     Certificate** next to the name of your course.
