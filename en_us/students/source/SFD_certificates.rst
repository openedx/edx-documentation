*******************************
About Verified Certificates
*******************************

Most, but not all, courses on edx.org offer :ref:`verified tracks<Enroll in
the Verified Track>` of study, from which you can earn verified certificates.
For more information about the benefits of verified certificates, and to see
an example of a verified certificate, see `Verified Certificates`_. For a list
of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course
catalog`_.

To earn a verified certificate from an edX course, you enroll in or upgrade to
the verified track in the course, pay the certificate fee, :ref:`verify your
identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID, and earn a
passing grade.

Verified certificates include the following information.

.. note::

  Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course or the
  number of credit hours that a university might offer for the course. Your
  final grade appears on your **Progress** page and on your dashboard. If you
  need a record of your grade, you can print your **Progress** page or
  dashboard.

Receiving a Certificate for a Course
***************************************

When you have completed the course requirements for a :ref:`verified
certificate<SFD Verified Certificates>`, including paying the certificate fee,
verifying your identity, and earning a passing grade in the course's verified
track, you can access your certificate when course certificates become
available.

For self-paced and instructor-paced courses that :ref:`generate certificates
at specific times<SFD Generated Certificates>`, when your certificate for a
course is available, a link to the certificate and your final grade are
visible on the course card on your dashboard.

.. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_Cert_web.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: Dashboard with course name, grade, and link to the certificate.

Follow these steps to access your certificate.

#. On your dashboard, select **View Certificate** on the course card to open
   the certificate in your browser.

#. Print or share your certificate. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Sharing
   or Printing a Certificate`.

.. note:: Different self-paced courses issue certificates at different
   intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others issue
   certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
   specific certificate schedule, see the **Course** page or course team updates
   for your course.

   A few self-paced courses offer :ref:`on-demand certificates<SFD On Demand
   Certificates>`, allowing you to generate your own certificate as soon as
   you qualify.


.. _SFD Generated Certificates:

==================================================================
Generated Certificates for Instructor-Paced and Self-Paced Courses
==================================================================

Instructor-paced and self-paced courses generate certificates at different
intervals determined by the course teams.

In most :ref:`instructor-paced courses<SFD Instructor Paced>`, which have
specific course start and end dates, the course team generates certificates
within two weeks of the end of the course.

In most :ref:`self-paced courses<SFD Self Paced>`, which you can start and
complete at any time, the course team generates certificates at specific
intervals, such as once a month. You qualify for a certificate when you complete
all course requirements and achieve a passing grade. You can access your
certificate when it becomes available.

.. note:: Different self-paced courses issue certificates at different
   intervals. Some courses issue certificates once a month, and others issue
   certificates less frequently. For more information about your course's
   specific certificate schedule, see the **Course** page or course team updates
   for your course.

   A few self-paced courses offer :ref:`on-demand certificates<SFD On Demand
   Certificates>`, allowing you to generate your own certificate as soon as
   you qualify.


.. _SFD On Demand Certificates:

======================
On-Demand Certificates
======================

In some courses, as soon as you complete enough of the course with a grade that
qualifies you for a certificate, you can request and download your certificate.
You do not have to wait until you finish the course or until the :ref:`course
team generates certificates<SFD Generated Certificates>`.

You can usually find out if a course offers on-demand certificates on the
course's About page.

For courses that offer on-demand certificates, as soon as you have achieved
the required grade in the course, you see a message at the top of the course
**Progress** page indicating that you have qualified for a certificate.

At this point, you can keep working toward a higher grade in the course, or you
can request your certificate immediately.

.. Caution::  The grade that is displayed on your dashboard reflects your
   grade at the time that you request your on-demand certificate. If you
   complete more assignments to raise your grade, the grade on your
   **Progress** page changes, but the grade listed on your dashboard is not
   updated.

To receive and download your on-demand certificate after you qualify, follow
these steps.

#. On the course **Progress** page, select **Request Certificate**.

   After you request your certificate, the certificate creation process can
   take up to 48 hours. When your certificate is ready, a "Your certificate is
   available" message appears on your **Progress** page.

#. Download your certificate from the **Progress** page or from your dashboard.

   * To download your certificate from the **Progress** page, select
     **Download Your Certificate** in the upper right corner of the page.

   * To download your certificate from your dashboard, select **Download Your
     Certificate** next to the name of your course.

Share a Web Certificate URL
===========================

Both course certificates and program certificates have a certificate ID that
you can share with schools and potential employers so that they can verify
that you received your certificate. The certificate ID is a 32-digit series of
numbers and letters that is found at the bottom of the certificate.

To share the certificate URL, you find the certificate URL and then distribute
the URL using email, social media, or your method of choice.

To find the certificate URL, use one of the following methods.

* Use the browser address bar.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then select the certificate ID.

     The certificate opens in a new browser page.

  #. Copy the URL from the browser address bar.

* Get the URL from the certificate ID.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then right-click the certificate
     ID.

  #. From the menu, select **Copy Link Location**.

     The URL is copied to your computer's clipboard.

* Create the URL manually.

  #. Open the certificate in your browser, and then copy the certificate ID.

  #. Use the following URL, replacing ``certificate_ID`` with the certificate
     ID that you copied.

     ::

       https://courses.edx.org/certificates/<certificate_ID>

     For example, your certificate URL might resemble the following URL.

     ::

       https://courses.edx.org/certificates/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j10k11l12m13n1

   (PDF)** option instead of a **View Certificate** option.

    For information about adding your edX certification from a PDF certificate to

#. On your learner dashboard, locate the course whose certificate you want to
   share.

#. Select **Download Certificate (PDF)**.

   The certificate opens.

   certificate URL might resemble this one:

   ``https://verify.edx.org/cert/76558cdc28204605809a99a9dd8bafaf``

  might need to select the **Minimum** option for the margins.

* Make sure that your browser's print settings are set to include the
  background graphics for your certificate.
