******************************
Course Tracks
******************************


When you enroll in an edX course, you automatically enroll in the audit track
for that course. All courses offer an audit track. The audit track is free of
charge, and offers you access to all course materials, including assignments
and exams.

In addition to the audit track, which does not include a certificate, many
courses offer a verified certificate track. This track awards verified
certificates to learners who successfully complete the course and verify
their identities. Verified certificates carry a fee that varies by course.
For more information, see :ref:`SFD Verified Certificates`.

******************************
Enroll in a Course
******************************

To enroll in a course, follow these steps.

#. On the edX home page, select the course that you want to take.

#. When the About page for the course opens, select **Enroll Now** in the
   upper right corner of the page.

   * If the course offers only an audit track, you are enrolled in the course
     after you select **Enroll Now**.

   * If the course offers a verified certificate track in addition to the audit
     track, and you want to earn a verified certificate, you must upgrade to
     the verified certificate track after you select **Enroll Now**.

     To upgrade to a verified certificate, select **Pursue a Verified
     Certificate**, and then follow the instructions to pay the course fee and
     verify your identity. You must pay the course fee before you can begin
     the course. You do not have to verify your identity immediately, but you
     must verify your identity before the course ID verification deadline has
     passed. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your Identity`.

     For more information about verified certificates, see :ref:`SFD Verified
     Certificates`.

     After you submit a payment for a verified certificate, you can view that
     payment at any time. For more information, see :ref:`View Order History`.

#. After you enroll in the course, your dashboard opens automatically. When
   your dashboard opens, verify that the new course appears in your list of
   courses.

If you select **View Course** on your dashboard, the **Home** page for
the course opens. If the course has already started, you can select the
**Course** page to access released course materials.

.. note:: Course instructors occasionally enroll learners directly in a
 course. If this is the case, you receive an email that contains a link to the
 course. Select the link to enroll in the course.

****************************
Change Your Course Track
****************************

You might enroll in the audit track for a course, but then decide that you want
to earn a verified certificate. Or you might enroll in the verified certificate
track for a course, but then decide that you want to audit the course instead.
If the course has recently started, you might be able to change your course
track.

====================================================
Change to the Verified Certificate Track
====================================================

You can upgrade to the verified certificate track until enrollment for verified
certificates ends for your course, usually two or more weeks after the course
starts.

To upgrade to the verified certificate track, go to your dashboard, and then
select **Upgrade to Verified Track** under the name of your course. You then
follow the instructions to register for a verified certificate. If the
**Upgrade to Verified Track** does not exist, the enrollment deadline for the
verified certificate track has passed.

If you have questions about changing your certificate type, contact the edX
support team at `technical@edx.org <mailto://technical@edx.org>`_.

==========================
Change to the Audit Track
==========================

To change from the verified certificate track to the audit track, go to your
dashboard, and then select **Unenroll** under the name of your course. The
edX support team will contact you with information about a refund. To receive a refund, you must
change to the audit track before verified certificate enrollment closes for
your course.

If you do not see an **Unenroll** option, enrollment for verified
certificates has closed. Enrollment for verified certificates typically closes
two weeks after the course has started, or after at least one assignment due
date has passed.

If you have questions about changing your certificate type, contact the edX
support team at `technical@edx.org <mailto://technical@edx.org>`_.

.. _SFD Verify Your Identity:

******************************
Verify Your Identity
******************************

.. note::

  When you verify your identity for one course, you verify your identity for
  all edX courses. Verification is effective for one year. If you enroll in
  another verified course within that year, you do not have to verify your
  identity again.

When you enroll in the verified certificate track for a course, you do not
have to verify your identity immediately, but you must verify your identity
before the course ID verification deadline. The deadline appears below the
name of the course on your dashboard.

To verify your identity, you use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of
a government-issued photo ID to edX's authorization service. We encrypt your
photos and use the highest levels of security available to protect your data.
If your computer does not have a webcam, you must verify your identity on a
computer that does have a webcam.



.. note:: If you enroll in a course that offers academic credit, you might have
 to verify your identity periodically during the course. For more information,
 see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

.. note:: You must have a webcam and a government-issued photo ID to
 verify your identity.

#. Start the verification process by completing one of the following actions.

   * If you have not yet enrolled in the course, select **Pursue a Verified
     Certificate**, submit payment information, and then select **Verify Now**
     on the payment confirmation page.

   * If you enrolled in the audit track of the course, select **Upgrade to
     Verified Track** next to the course on your dashboard.

   * If you enrolled in the verified track and submitted payment but you have
     not yet verified your identity, select **Verify Now** next to the course
     on your dashboard.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon below your image to
   take a picture of your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines to the right of your image.

#. Review your photo. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake
   Photo**. When you are satisfied with your photo, select **Next: Take a
   photo of your ID** in the lower right corner.

#. On the **Take a Photo of Your ID** page, hold your government-issued photo
   ID up to the webcam on your computer. Make sure the ID in the image is
   legible, and then select the camera icon below the image box to take a
   photo of your ID.

#. Review your photo. If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake
   Photo**. When you are satisfied with your photo, select **Next: Review Your
   Info** in the lower right corner.

#. On the **Review Your Photos** page, review the photos of your face and of
   your ID. Make sure that the photos meet the requirements listed under
   **Photo requirements**, and then select **Confirm** in the lower right
   corner.

   .. important:: If your ID uses non-Roman characters, you must edit your edX
    account name in this step to use non-Roman characters so that your edX
    account name exactly matches the name on your ID. To do this, select
    **Edit Your Name** in the list of requirements, and then enter your name
    in non-Roman characters in the text box.

      :alt: The Review Your Photos page with a photo of an ID with non-Roman
        characters and a callout indicating where the learner enters his full
        name.

A verification confirmation page opens and confirms that you have submitted
your ID verification photos.

After edX's authorization service examines your photo, you receive a message
on your dashboard that informs you whether the verification process was
successful. If the verification process was not successful, you must submit
new verification photos. You can begin the verification process again by
selecting **Verify Your Identity**.
