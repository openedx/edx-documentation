About edX Courses and Programs
*******************************

EdX offers both individual courses and groups of related courses, called
programs.

=========================
Course Enrollment Options
=========================

To learn about a course, select the course in the `edX course catalog`_ and
review its About page. The About page provides information including a course
description, the institution that offers the course, the hours of work that you
should expect to spend on the course each week, and the enrollment options, or
tracks, that the course offers.

When you enroll in an edX course, you select either the audit or verified
enrollment track, depending on whether you want to earn a verified certificate
for your course.

About the Audit Track
**********************

Most courses offer an audit track. The audit track does not include a
certificate when you complete your course. The audit track is free of charge,
and includes access to all course materials, including assignments and exams.
You are automatically enrolled in the audit track when you enroll in a course.

After you enroll in the audit track, if the course offers a verified track and
the deadline for enrolling in the verified track has not passed, you can
upgrade to the verified track. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Change to
the Verified Track`.

.. _SFD Verified Track:

About the Verified Track
************************

Many courses offer a verified track in addition to the audit track. The
verified track awards verified certificates to learners who submit payment,
:ref:`verify their identities<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a
government-issued photo ID, and pass the course.

When you enroll in the verified track, you pay a fee that varies by course. The
fee helps support edX's mission. The amount of the fee is listed on the About
page for that course. If you are unable to pay the certificate fee, you can
apply for financial assistance using the `financial assistance application`_.

.. note::
  When you enroll in the verified track, you must submit your payment before
  you can see course content. You do not have to verify your identity at that
  time. However, you must verify your identity before the deadline for
  verification in that course. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Verify Your
  Identity`.

If a course has a verified track, you see a "Verified" indication on the course
image in the course catalog on edx.org.

For more information about enrolling in the verified track for a course, see
:ref:`SFD Enroll in a Course` or :ref:`SFD Change to the Verified Track`.

For a list of all courses that currently offer verified certificates, see the
`edX course catalog`_.

For more information about verified certificates, see `Verified Certificates`_
on the edx.org website.

========
Programs
========

In addition to taking individual edX courses, you can enroll in an XSeries
program. An XSeries program is a group of courses that explore a specific
subject in depth. An XSeries program offers an XSeries certificate after you
earn a verified certificate for all of the courses in the program. All courses
in an XSeries program offer verified certificates.

XSeries programs have an "XSeries program" indication in the course catalog on
edx.org. To learn more about the program and its courses, select the program.

To complete an XSeries program, you must earn a verified certificate in each of
the courses in the program.

For more information about XSeries programs, see `XSeries Programs`_ on
edx.org.

For a list of all XSeries programs, see the `edX course catalog`_.

.. _SFD Verify Your Identity:

******************************
Verifying Your Identity
******************************

When you enroll in the :ref:`verified track<SFD Verified Track>` for a course,
you must use a webcam to take a photograph of yourself and of a
government-issued photo ID. You do not have to verify your identity
immediately, but you must verify your identity before the course ID
verification deadline. The deadline appears below the name of the course on
your dashboard.

To verify your identity, you use a webcam to submit a photo of yourself and of
a government-issued photo ID to edX's authorization service. EdX encrypts your
photos and uses the highest levels of security available to protect your data.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

When you verify your identity for an edX course, that verification is effective
for one year.

* If you enroll in the verified track for another course, you must verify your
  identity for that course separately.

* If you enroll in a course that offers academic credit, you might have to
  verify your identity periodically during the course. For more information,
  see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

===================================
Preparing to Verify Your Identity
===================================

When you enroll in the verified track for a course, you must use a webcam to
take a photograph of yourself and of a government-issued photo ID. Before you
begin the identity verification process, follow these recommendations to make
the process as straightforward as possible.

* Make sure that you have access to a webcam.

  If your computer does not have a webcam, edX recommends that you find out if
  your local library has a webcam that you can use, or that you borrow a
  friend's webcam. If you have a smartphone that has a camera, you can also
  verify your identity by visiting the following page in the smartphone's
  browser.

  https://courses.edx.org/verify_student/reverify

  You can sign in to one computer or smartphone to verify your identity, and
  then sign in to the computer that you typically use to complete the course.
  If you do not use a webcam to verify your identity, you cannot receive a
  verified certificate.

* Compare the way that your name appears when you sign in to edx.org to the way
  it appears on your ID card. Your name must be the same for both, including
  the type of characters used (Roman or non-Roman), accented characters,
  initials, and spelling.

  You can update your edX account name at any time on the edX :ref:`account
  settings page<SFD Account Settings>`. You also have the opportunity to change
  your edX account name during the identity verification process.

* Make sure that your identification card is government issued, such as a
  driver's license or passport.

* Make sure that your name is legible, and that your name and photo are visible
  together on a single image.

  If your name and your photo are on two different pages, or on the front and
  back of a single page, you can copy both pages onto a single piece of paper.
  Make sure that your name is legible in the copy.

* Make sure that you can adjust the lighting for the photographs.

  For the webcam to focus, there needs to be enough light on your face and your
  ID. You might need to change the position or brightness of a lamp, or change
  your position, to improve the lighting for the photographs.

=========================
Verify Your Identity
=========================

To verify your identity, follow these steps.

#. Make sure that you have a webcam and a government-issued photo ID available.

#. Start the verification process by completing one of the following actions.

   * If you have not yet enrolled in the course, :ref:`enroll in the verified
     track<Enroll in the Verified Track>`, submit your payment information, and
     then select **Verify Now** on the payment confirmation page.

   * If you enrolled in the audit track of the course, :ref:`upgrade to the
     verified track<Upgrade to the Verified Track>`.

   * If you enrolled in the verified track and submitted payment but you have
     not yet verified your identity, on your dashboard of courses select
     **Verify Now** next to the course.

#. At the top of your browser window, a message asks you to share the camera
   with edx.org. To see and respond to this message every time you take or
   retake a photograph for the verification process, select **Share Selected
   Device**. To share the webcam throughout the process select **Always
   Share**.

#. On the **Take Your Photo** page, select the camera icon to take a photo of
   your face.

   For information about how to take a good photo, review the **To take a
   successful photo** guidelines beside your image.

#. Review your photo to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the available
   space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Take a photo of your
     ID**.

#. On the **Take a Photo of Your ID** page, hold your government-issued photo
   ID up to the webcam on your computer. Make sure that the image of your ID is
   legible, and then select the camera icon to take a photo of your ID.

#. Review the photo of your ID to make sure that it is well-lit and fills the
   available space.

   * If you are not satisfied with the photo, select **Retake Photo**.

   * When you are satisfied with the photo, select **Next: Review your
     Info**.

#. On the **Review Your Photos** page, review the photos of your face and of
   your ID. Make sure that the photos meet all of the requirements listed under
   **Photo requirements**.

   If the name on your ID is different from your edX account name, select
   **Edit Your Name**. You must edit your edX account name to exactly match the
   name on your ID.

   .. image:: ../../shared/students/Images/SFD_VerifyID_NonRoman.png

      :alt: The Review Your Photos page with a photo of an ID with non-Roman
        characters and a callout indicating where the learner enters his full
        name.

   For example, if your ID shows your name in Chinese characters, but your edX
   account name appears in Roman characters, you must update your edX account
   name to match the name on your ID.

#. After you make sure that your photos meet all of the requirements listed
   under **Photo requirements** select **Confirm**.

   A message confirms that you have submitted your photos.

After edX's authorization service examines your photos, a message on your
dashboard informs you whether the verification process was successful. If the
verification process was not successful, you must submit new verification
photos. You can begin the verification process again by selecting **Verify Your
Identity**.

==================================================
Troubleshooting the Identity Verification Process
==================================================

If you have a problem during the identity verification process, these
suggestions might help you find a resolution.

* Make sure that you are using a :ref:`supported browser<learners:Browsers>`.

  You can also switch from one browser, such as Internet Explorer or Safari, to
  another browser, such as Firefox or Chrome.

* To take photographs, the webcam uses `Adobe Flash Player`_. You might need to
  install this application or update to the latest version.
