the course or program, including the course or program duration, the hours of
work that you should expect to spend each week, the institution that offers the

.. _Course Availability:

============================
When is a Course Available?
============================

Every course on edx.org has a status that tells you when it is available. When
you search for courses on edx.org, you can refine your search by availability.

.. note:: You can enroll in courses which have start dates in the future, but
   you cannot access course content or assignments before the start date.

.. image:: ../../shared/images/SFD_Search_RefineByAvailability.png

   :alt: The course availability options under "Refine Your Search" on edx.org.

* **Current** - the course is in session now.
* **Starting Soon** - the course will start within 60 days.
* **Upcoming** - the course will start in more than 60 days.
* **Archived** - the course has ended. You can only enroll in the audit track of
  an archived course. Once enrolled, you can access course materials, but you
  cannot receive a grade. Some features, such as course discussions and
  assignments, might not be available.

Some courses are offered at multiple times during the year. Most edX courses
are repeated, but scheduling is up to the individual course team.

If a course that you want to take is offered at other times in the future, a
**More Dates** option is available above the current course's start date
information and **Enroll Now** button. Select **More Dates** to see other
times that the course is offered, and enroll in any of the available times.

.. _SFD About Audit Track:

About the Audit Track
*********************

Most courses offer an audit track. The audit track is free of charge, and does
not include a certificate when you complete your course. The audit track gives
you access to all course materials, including assignments and exams.

When you first enroll in a course, you are automatically enrolled in the audit
track. For information about enrolling in the audit track for a course, see
:ref:`Enroll in the Audit Track`.

If the course you enrolled in offers a verified track and the deadline for
enrolling in the verified track has not passed, you can choose to upgrade to the
verified track to earn a certificate. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Change
to the Verified Track`.


.. _SFD Verified Track:

About the Verified Track
*************************

Most courses offer a verified track in addition to the free audit track. The
verified track has a fee, and offers a certificate when you pass the course.

If a course has a verified track, you see a "Verified" indication on the course
image in the course catalog on edx.org. For a list of all courses that currently
offer verified certificates, see the `edX course catalog`_.

Verified Track>` in the course, you submit payment, and, some time before the
verification deadline, you must :ref:`verify your identity<SFD Verify Your
Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID.

.. note:: The fee for the verified track varies by course. The amount of the fee
   is listed on the About page for that course. The fee helps support edX's
   mission. If you are unable to pay the verified track fee, you can apply for
   financial assistance using the `financial assistance application`_.
