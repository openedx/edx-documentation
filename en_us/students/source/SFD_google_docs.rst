Embedded Google Documents
##############################

Some courses include embedded Google documents, such as text documents,
spreadsheets, and presentations. These documents appear in the body of your
course just like any other courseware. Your course may also include a Google
calendar.

.. Mark: Do we have any images of good examples? I'd love to include a screen
.. shot but don't want to just show the default Google Document Tool
.. presentation.

Your course may include the following types of Google documents:

* Document
* Drawing
* Form
* Presentation
* Spreadsheet

You can't edit Google documents, but you can interact with many of them. For
example, you can complete a form, view all of the slides in a presentation, and
experiment with different values in a spreadsheet.

***********************
Google Calendar
***********************

If your course includes a Google calendar, you can view that calendar in the course or integrate it with your own Google calendar. 

When you view the calendar in your course, the times on the calendar reflect
universal coordinated time (UTC), not your local time. The time zone information
for the calendar appears in the lower part of the screen. 

If you integrate the calendar with your own Google calendar, the times and dates
adjust automatically to reflect your local time.

Access to Google Documents

Google services are blocked in some regions and countries. If Google services
are blocked in your area, a black box appears in the place of the Google
document or calendar.
