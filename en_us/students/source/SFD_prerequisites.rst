Course Prerequisites

Some edX courses require that you have a particular set of skills or knowledge
before you begin the course. Many courses include information about these
general requirements on their About page.

In addition to requiring general skills and knowledge, some courses require
students to pass a specific prerequisite edX course or pass an entrance exam.

.. _Prerequisite edX Course:

When a course has a prerequisite edX course, you can see information about the
prerequisite course on the About page for the course that you want to take.

It is possible to enroll in the course even if you haven't taken the
prerequisite course. When you enroll in the course, the course appears on your
Student Dashboard. However, you cannot click or select the course to access the
course content. Below the name of the course, you can see the name of the
prerequisite course, as well as a link to that course.

When you select the link, the About page for the prerequisite course opens.
You can then enroll in the prerequisite course.

After you successfully complete the prerequisite course, the other course
becomes available on your dashboard, just like other edX courses. You can then
click or select the course to access any available materials.

.. _Entrance Exam:

**************************
Entrance Exam
**************************

If you enroll in a course that requires an entrance exam, the course appears on
your Student Dashboard. However, you cannot access all released course content
immediately.

The first time that you access the course, the course opens to the **Course
Updates & News** page. At the top of the page, instead of seeing several tabs,
you only see one tab. The name of this tab is usually **Entrance Exam**, though
it may have another name in your course.

To begin the entrance exam, select the **Entrance Exam** tab.

After you pass the entrance exam, you can see all available sections in the course accordion, and you can access all available materials for the
course.
