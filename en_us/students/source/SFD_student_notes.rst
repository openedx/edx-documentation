In some edX courses, you can use the Student Notes feature to highlight and make
notes about what you read right in the body of the course. You can see
individual notes inside the course content, or you can see all of your notes at
once on the **Notes** tab.

 However, the student notes feature is currently not available for exercises,
 videos, or PDF textbooks.

Using Student Notes
***************************

When a course includes student notes, every page has a **Notes** tab at the top
and a pencil icon in the lower-right corner.

The **Notes** tab lists all the notes that you have made during the course. For more information, see :ref:`The Notes Tab`.


======================================

#. After you've finished writing your note, click **Save** or press ENTER. The
   note editor closes, and the text that you selected remains highlighted.

If you want to highlight a passage without making a note, open the note
editor by following the steps above, and then click **Save** or press ENTER.
When you hover over the highlighted text, the note field contains the words "no
comment".

======================
View and Search Notes
======================

You can view your course notes in two places. 

* You can view individual notes in the place in the course where you created the
  notes. To see your notes, go to the unit that contains your note and hover
  over or click the highlighted text. When you click the highlighted text, your
  note remains open until you click outside the highlighted text.

* You can view all the notes you've made in the course on the **Notes** tab. You
  can also search your notes on this tab.

The **Notes** tab lists both the text that you selected and the note that you
made. You can sort the notes by the date you created or edited them, or by the
location of the note in the course.

the course. To see your note in the body of the course, click the link under

To search your notes, type a search term in the **Search notes for** box, and
then either click the magnifying glass icon or press ENTER.
