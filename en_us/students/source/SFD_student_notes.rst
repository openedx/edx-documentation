In some edX courses, you can use the Student Notes feature to highlight and
make notes about what you read right in the body of the course. Your notes can
contain text as well as tags that you add to categorize your notes.

When a course includes student notes, every page has a **Notes** tab at the
top and a pencil icon in the lower right corner. You can see individual notes
inside the course content, or you can see all of your notes at once on the
**Notes** tab.

     (-) or underscores (_) to separate words in the tag.
