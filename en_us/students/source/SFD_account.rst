*********************************
Introducing edx.org and edX Edge
*********************************

EdX hosts courses on the `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_ websites.

* edx.org hosts massive open online courses (MOOCs), designed and led by edX
  institutional partners. Courses on edx.org are publicly listed for enrollment
  by learners from around the world.

* EdX Edge hosts small private online courses (SPOCs), which are often used to
  deliver course content to on campus students. Courses on Edge typically limit
  enrollment. Edge does not have a course catalog, so you must receive an
  invitation to enroll and participate in a course on Edge.

.. note:: 
 The user accounts on edx.org and edX Edge are separate. If you take courses on
 both websites, you must complete the account registration process on both
 sites.

******************
Create an Account
******************

Before you create, or register, an account on an edX website, note that course
team members and other learners see the name that you enter as your public
username, not the full name that you enter. You cannot change your public
username after you register.

To register an account on an edX website, go to the `edx.org registration`_
page, or follow the link in your course invitation email message, and then
follow these steps.

The edX Demo Course
******************************

If you are new to online learning, you might want to take the `edX Demo
course`_. EdX provides this demonstration course to give you a way to explore
and learn how to take an edX course.
