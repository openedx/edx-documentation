*********************************
Introducing edx.org and edX Edge
*********************************

EdX hosts courses on the `edx.org`_ and `edX Edge`_ websites.

* The edx.org website has massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are designed
  and led by edX partner organizations. This website lists all available
  courses publicly, and learners from around the world can find and enroll in
  these courses.

* EdX Edge has small private online courses (SPOCs), which are often created
  for use on campus or within an organization. Courses on Edge frequently limit
  enrollment. Edge does not list available courses publicly. To enroll in a
  course on Edge, you must receive an email message with an invitation to
  enroll and the course URL from the course team. You do not need to create an
  account on Edge unless you have received an invitation to enroll in an Edge
  course.

.. note::  The user accounts on edx.org and edX Edge are separate. If you take
   courses on both websites, you must complete the account registration
   process on each of the two sites.
