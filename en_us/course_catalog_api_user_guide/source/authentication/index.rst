.. _edX API Authentication:

###############################################
Authenticating as an edX REST Web Service User
###############################################


The edX Course Catalog API is a REST web services API. An API client is a
program, utility, or other tool that you can use to exchange messages with an
API. When you use the edX API, you use a client to make requests and receive
response data. Clients must authenticate when they make API requests.
Authenticating allows the edX API to verify the identity of the client and
associate that identity with a specific edX.org user.

When a client authenticates with the edX API, the client completes the
following process.

* The client presents a client identifier and a secret string to the
  ``/oauth2/v1/access_token`` authentication resource and receives an access
  token.

* The client includes the access token when the client makes another API
  request.

An access token is a text string that includes encoded information about the
client, the user, and the period of time in which the token is valid. Access
tokens expire after a period of time that is specified when you request them.
After an access token expires, you must get a new token from the
``/oauth2/v1/access_token`` authentication resource.

The following diagram shows a client presenting its client ID and client
secret to the ``/oauth2/v1/access_token`` authentication resource. The
authentication resource returns an access token.

The following diagram shows a client presenting an access token when the client
requests a resource. After the edX API accepts the access token, it returns the
resource data.

The edX API uses the OAuth 2.0 standard for authentication. OAuth
2.0 is an open standard used by many systems that require secure user
authentication. See the `OAuth 2.0 Standard`_ for more information.

The edX API uses JSON web tokens (JWT) as access tokens for authentication. JWT
access tokens are digitally signed and encoded strings of information about the
edX user who presents the token. For more information about JWT, see
`JWT <https://jwt.io>`_.

The example API requests shown in this guide use the ``curl`` command-line
program to send HTTP messages to the edX API. You can use any technology to
send REST API requests. The examples use the ``curl`` program to show the
syntax and data for a request in a way that is easy to read. For more
information about the ``curl`` program, see `curl client program`_.

The following sections provide more information about authenticating as an edX
API user.

change the existing **Name** and **Redirect URIs** values.

.. _getting_an_access_token:

*********************************************
Getting an Access Token
*********************************************

To get an access token, you send a ``POST`` request to the
``/oauth2/v1/access_token`` authentication resource. The response you receive
contains the access token string.

To get an access token for the edX API, follow these steps.

#. Make sure you have the client ID and client secret strings for your API
   client.

#. Send a ``POST`` HTTP request to the ``/oauth2/v1/access_token``
   authentication resource. Include your client identifier and client secret in
   the message body of your ``POST`` request. Include the client ID and secret
   in a string that includes ``grant_type=client_credentials`` and
   ``token_type=jwt`` as shown in the following example.

   ``grant_type=client_credentials&client_id={client id}&client_secret={client
   secret}&token_type=jwt``

   For an example request, see :ref:`example_access_token_request`.

#. Find the access token string in the ``access_token`` value in the JSON
   response data. For more information about the authentication endpoint
   response data, see :ref:`authentication_endpoint_response`.

   The following example ``access_token`` value includes an access token
   string.

.. _example_access_token_request:

====================================
Example Access Token Request
====================================

The following example ``curl`` program command requests an access token from
the edX API authentication endpoint.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -X POST -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=VB1AkrAE28ArNnOizi4OEKq03UGu9oI0h9DPbvwe&client_secret=wFMUqjZKQzboPEQSBLxERatup7r772hzg98xLu6fr6s7vIta5Xj3MPmrKEZbfPdPjagkBdmLjQXlqu2IMC2TnaMutVLZF9AGXn9LqZv9P9oE73pAV6L4iZxzpuQBuTmk&token_type=jwt" https://api.edx.org/oauth2/v1/access_token

.. _authentication_endpoint_response:

==================================================
Understanding the Authentication Endpoint Response
==================================================

The edX API authentication endpoint returns JSON data that includes an
access token string and information about that access token.

The values in the authentication endpoint response data are described in the
following list.

* ``access_token``: The access token string that you can use to make API
  requests.

* ``expires_in``: The length of time, in seconds, that the access token will be
  accepted. The period of time starts when the authentication service issues
  the token.

* ``scope``: The internal resources that your API client has access to. You do
  not need to use the information in the ``scope`` value.

* ``token_type``: A description of the format of the access token. You specify
  the format of an access token when you use that token to make API requests.


The following example JSON response data shows the ``access_token`` value and
the access token string.

.. _using_an_access_token:

*********************************************
Using an Access Token to Make REST Requests
*********************************************

To make an edX API request, you include an access token string in the
``Authorization`` HTTP header field. In addition to the access token string,
you specify the token type, for example ``JWT``.

The following example ``curl`` program command sends a request to an edX API
endpoint. The example request includes the token type and access token string
in the ``Authorization`` HTTP header field.

.. code-block:: bash

  curl -X GET -H "Authorization: JWT 4IHZlbCB2aXZlcnJhIGdyYXZpZGEsIHJpc3V.TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQsIGNvbnNlY3RldHVyIGFkaXBpc2NpbmcgZWxpdC4gRXRpYW0gdGluY2lkdW50IG9kaW8gZWdldCB0aW5jaWR1bnQgcG9ydGEuIEZ1c2NlIHZlaGljdWxhIGFyY3UgdGVsbHVzLCBzaXQgYW1ldCBmcmluZ2lsbGEgZXN0IHByZXRpdW0gc2VkLiBDdXJhYml0dXIgY29uc2VxdWF0IHVsdHJpY2llcyB0cmlzdGlxdWUuIEluIGVzdCBwdXJ1cywgZmFjaWxpc2lzIGFjIGxlY3R1cyBxdWlzLCBsdWN0dXMgdGVtcG9yIG9yY2kuIEludGVnZXIgdml0.YWUgbmVxdWUgbGlndWxhLiBVdCBjb25zZXF1YXQsIGV" https://api.edx.org/catalog/v1/catalogs/
