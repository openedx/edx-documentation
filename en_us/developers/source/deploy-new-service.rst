.. _Deploy a New Service:

Deploy a New Service
***********************************

Intro
=====

This page is a work-in-progress aimed at capturing all of the details needed to
deploy a new service in the edX environment.

Considerations
==============

What Does Your Service Do
-------------------------
Understanding how your service works and what it does helps Ops support the
service in production.

Sizing and Resource Profile
---------------------------
What class of machine does your service require? What resources are most likely
to be bottlenecks for your service: CPU, memory, bandwidth, something else?

Customers
---------
Who will be using your service? What is the anticipated initial usage? What
factors will cause usage to grow? How many users can your service support?

Code
----
What repository or repositories does your service require. Will your service be
deployed from a non-public repo?

Ideally your service should follow the same release management process as the
LMS. This is documented in the wiki, so please ensure you understand that
process in depth.

Was the service code reviewed?

Settings
--------
How does your service read in environment specific settings? Were all hard-
coded references to values that should be settings, such as database URLs and
credentials, message queue endpoints, and so on, found and resolved during code
review?

License
-------
Is the license included in the repo?

How does your service run
-------------------------
Is it HTTP based? Does it run periodically? Both?

Persistence
-----------
Ops will need to know the following things.

* What persistence needs does you service have

  * Will it connect to an existing database?
  * Will it connect to Mongo

* What are the least permissive permissions your service needs to do its job.

Logging
-------

It is important that your application logging in built out to provide
sufficient feedback for problem determination as well as ensuring that it is
operating as desired. It is also important that your service log uses our
deployment standards, for example, logs vs. syslog in deployment environments,
and the standard log format for syslog. Can the logs be consumed by Splunk?
They should not be if they contain data discussed in the Data Security section
below.

Metrics
-------
What are the key metrics for your application? Concurrent users? Transactions
per second? Ideally you should create a DataDog view that captures the key
metrics for your service and provided an instant gauge of overall service
health.

Messaging
---------
Does your service need to access a message queue?

Email
-----
Does your service need to send email?

Access to Other Service
-----------------------
Does your service need access to other services, either within or outside of
the edX environment? Some example might be, the comment service, the LMS,
YouTube, s3 buckets, and so on.

Service Monitoring
------------------
Your service should have a facility for remote monitoring that has the
following characteristics.

* It should exercise all the components that your service requires to run
  successfully.
* It should be necessary and sufficient for ensuring your service is healthy.
* It should be secure.
* It should not open your service to DDOS attacks.

Fault Tolerance and Scalability
-------------------------------
How can your application be deployed to ensure that it is fault tolerant and
scalable?

Network Access
--------------
From where should your service be accessible?

Data Security
-------------
Will your application be storing or handling data in any of the following
categories?

* Personally Identifiable Information in General, e.g., user's email addresses.
* Tracking log data
* edX confidential data

Testing
-------
Has your service been load tested? What there the details of the test. What
determinations can we make regarding when we will need to scale if usage trend
upward? How can ops exercise your service in order to tests end-to-end
integration. We love no-op-able tasks.

Additional Requirements
-----------------------
Anything else we should know about.
