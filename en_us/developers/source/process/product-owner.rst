Product Owner
*************

The product owner has two main responsibilities: approving user-facing features
and improvements from a product point of view, and prioritizing pull request
reviews.

When a contributor is interested in developing a new feature, or enhancing
an existing one, they can engage in a dialogue with the product team about
the feature: why it is needed, what does it do, etc. Product owners are expected
to fully engage in this process and treat contributors like customers. If
the idea is good but the implementation idea is poor, direct them to a better
solution. If the feature is not something we can support at this time, provide
a detailed explanation of why that is.

Approving work involves more than just giving the idea a go-ahead.  There are a
number of factors to consider.

- What level of support will edX provide? Unsupported, provisional, or
  supported?

- Will edx.org use the feature? Does it need configuration support?

- How much documentation is needed for the feature?  Will edX write the
  documentation, or should the contributor provide it?

- Does the work require other review, such as user experience, design,
  accessibility, internationalization, training, or customer support? 

The earlier in the process these other roles are involved, the better the
process will work, and the better the final product will be.

A product owner is responsible for prioritizing pull requests from
contributors, and keeping them informed when prioritization slips. Pull
requests that are ready to be prioritized in the next sprint will have a
"Awaiting Prioritization" label on their JIRA review tickets. At every
product review meeting (which should happen each sprint), pull requests awaiting
prioritization should either be included in the sprint for the appropriate team
as a commitment to get the pull request reviewed, or the
product owner must inform the author of the pull request that the pull request
is still queued and is not being ignored. Contributors should be treated as
customers, and if their pull requests are delayed then they should be informed
of that, just as a product owner would inform any customer when that customerâ€™s
requests are delayed.
