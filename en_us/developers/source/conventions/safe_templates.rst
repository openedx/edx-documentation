Preventing Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
###############################################

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow user-supplied data to be
incorrectly executed as code in a web browser. It can be difficult to write
templates that are safe from XSS security vulnerabilities. This section
presents best practices for handling proper escaping in the Open edX platform
to avoid these vulnerabilities.

Philosophy and General Rules
****************************

The philosophy behind the recommendations in this section is to make things as
simple as possible for developers. Protecting against XSS vulnerabilities
typically requires properly escaping user-provided data before it is placed on
the page. Rather than trying to determine if data is user-provided and could
be compromised, we will play it safe and escape data whether it is user-
provided or not. Unfortunately, because there are many different rules for
escaping, you still must choose the proper type of escaping.

Here are some general rules.

#. **Escape always.** Assume that all data is untrusted and escape it
   appropriately. Do not try to determine whether data could or could not be
   manipulated by a user.

#. **Escape late.** Delay escaping as long as possible, until you can see the
   actual context and understand the proper escaping that is required for
   the context. Browsers interpret different contexts such as HTML, URLs,
   CSS, and Javascript/JSON with different rules, so there are different
   escaping requirements based on where the data is being used in a page.

#. **Escape appropriately.** Know what kind of data you have (for example,
   HTML, plain text, or JSON) and where it is going (for example, HTML or
   JavaScript). Choose the proper escaping function based on these details.

#. **Validation is not sufficient.** Validating inputs does not replace the
   need to properly escape. In some cases, this may reduce the likelihood of
   potential problems, but proper escaping is always necessary.

#. **Do not store escaped data.** Again, because you do not know ahead of time
   all the places that the data will be used, you must wait until you have
   the proper context to decide on the proper escaping.

Overview of Contexts
====================

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the relationship
between the different templates, different contexts of DOM creation and
manipulation, and different types of escaping. As a general rule, proper
escaping is related to the context in which the data is being written, and
might not match the context that will eventually be reading the data.

    :alt: A diagram detailing how data flows from Django applications and Django
     models through Mako templates and Django templates into an HTML page. Data can
     then flow from the HTML page into JavaScript, and back down into the DOM
     through jQuery or Underscore.js templates.

In the Open edX platform, data flows from the application to the initial HTML page
mainly through the use of Mako templates.

.. Make sure the numbers in the list below are in sync with the numbered arrows in
.. the safe-templates.png diagram above, if either the diagram or the list is modified.

Descriptions of each numbered arrow in the diagram follow.

#. This step represents the use of Mako templates to write general HTML tags
   (that is, tags other than ``<script>`` tags) to create the HTML page. Any
   data written to the page inside one of these HTML tags or HTML attributes
   must be HTML-escaped to be treated as plain text.

#. This step represents the use of Mako templates to write JavaScript inside
   a ``<script>`` tag in the HTML page. Data written to this context must all
   be JavaScript-escaped to keep it from mistakenly being treated as HTML.
   Note that this data should not be HTML-escaped, which must happen in a
   later step if it is written back to the DOM by JavaScript.

#. This step represents the loading and executing of JavaScript from the HTML
   page by the JavaScript engine. This step should be safe, if data was
   properly JavaScript-escaped earlier.

#. In this step, JavaScript might load additional data from HTML tags and
   attributes using the DOM. Sometimes data is passed in this way via data
   attributes. This data is typically read using jQuery functions, but it can
   be read using other JavaScript functions. The data can be in the form of
   plain text strings or JSON. If it is in the form of strings, this data
   should mostly be plain text. Be careful with the escaping in this case.
   Although the data is used in JavaScript, it is transmitted as HTML, and so
   must be HTML-escaped.

#. In this step, JavaScript is being used to edit the DOM, often by creating
   HTML tags or setting HTML attributes. Often this is done using jQuery
   functions. Since HTML tags and attributes are being written here, any plain
   text must be properly HTML-escaped.

#. This step represents a subset of DOM manipulation using JavaScript,
   specifically through use of Underscore.js templates. Although these
   templates have a specific syntax for escaping, because HTML tags and
   attributes are being written any plain text must be properly HTML-escaped.


HTML Context and Escaping
=========================

The outermost context of an HTML file is HTML. In an HTML context inside an
HTML file, data is kept safe by HTML-escaping.

How HTML-Escaping Makes HTML Safe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. highlight:: mako

Let's review a simple example of an XSS attack and how proper escaping might
prevent such an attack. Imagine that we find the following expression in a
Mako template.

.. code-block:: mako

    <div>${course_name}</div>

Imagine further that someone uses Studio to set the course name as shown in
this example, including the HTML ``<script>`` tag.

.. code-block:: mako

    <script>alert('XSS attack!');</script>

The following resulting unsafe page source is sent to the browser.

.. code-block:: mako

    <div><script>alert('XSS attack!');</script></div>

The browser would execute the JavaScript code in the ``<script>alert('XSS
attack!');</script>`` tag. The user has injected code into the page that would
display a pop-up alert, which we would not want to allow. Because this attack
could contain arbitrary JavaScript that would be executed by the browser with
the same trust as any JavaScript that is sent from the application, it has the
potential to do something much more malicious than simply displaying a pop-up.
An example might be to steal and email the user's cookies.

In Mako, you can introduce HTML-escaping for all expressions on a page using
the page directive with the ``h`` filter. Here is an example of an expression
that is properly HTML-escaped.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    <div>${course_name}</div>

The resulting safe page source is as follows.

.. code-block:: mako

    <div>&lt;script&gt;alert(&#39;XSS!&#39;);&lt;/script&gt;</div>

This time, the browser will not interpret the ``<script>`` tag as a JavaScript
context, and instead simply displays the original string in the page.


JavaScript Context and Escaping
===============================

The outermost context of a JavaScript file is JavaScript. An HTML file also
contains a JavaScript context inside a `<script>` tag. Inside a JavaScript
context, data is kept safe by JavaScript-escaping.

How JavaScript-Escaping Makes HTML Safe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is an example of an expression used in a valid JavaScript context. It is
created using a ``<script>`` tag inside a Mako template.

.. code-block:: mako

    <script type="text/javascript">
       var courseName = "${course_name}";
       ...
    </script>

For this example, imagine that someone uses Studio to set the course name as
shown here.

.. code-block:: mako

    ";alert('XSS attack!');"

The resulting unsafe page source, sent to the browser with no escaping, would
look like this.

.. code-block:: mako

    <script type="text/javascript">
       var courseName = "";alert('XSS attack!');"";
       ...
    </script>

You can see how the attacker closed out the string and again tricked the
browser into executing the malicious JavaScript in the context of JavaScript.
There are several reasons why you do not want to use the default HTML-escaping
here.

#. JavaScript-escaping will also escape all characters that are special
   characters in HTML, such as ``<``. However, JavaScript-escaping will
   escape ``<`` to ``\u003C``, rather than to ``&lt;``. This will still keep
   the browser from finding an HTML tag where it does not belong.

#. The resulting string might not ultimately be used in an HTML context, so
   HTML entities might not be the proper escaping.

The way to properly JavaScript-escape code in Mako is shown in the following
example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%! from openedx.core.djangolib.js_utils import js_escaped_string %>
    ...
    <script type="text/javascript">
       var courseName = "${course_name | n, js_escaped_string}";
       ...
    </script>

The code above would produce the following safe page source.

.. code-block:: mako

    <script type="text/javascript">
       var courseName = "\u0022\u003Balert(\u0027XSS attack!\u0027)\u003B\u0022\u0022\u003B";
       ...
    </script>

.. _CSS Context:

CSS Context and Escaping
========================

The browser treats any code inside a ``<style>`` tag or ``style`` attribute in
an HTML page as a CSS context, or something that requires CSS parsing. CSS
parsing has its own rules, and requires CSS-escaping.

In a CSS context, the following additional constraints are required to keep
user supplied data safe.

* User supplied data can only appear as the value of a style property. In other
  words, never allow a user to supply the entire contents of the style tag or
  style property, or anything outside of the limited scope of an individual
  property value.

* User supplied URLs must use one of these safe protocols: "http:", "https:",
  or "". Doing so prevents users from being able to supply a URL that uses the
  "javascript" protocol as an example.

* User supplied style property values must not contain ``expression(...)`` due
  to an IE feature that would enable arbitrary JavaScript to run.

There are no existing helper functions for these additional constraints in the
platform. If you need to use user supplied data in a CSS context, you must
work with edX to help expand the suite of available helpers.

For more information, see
`OWASP: CSS and XSS <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.234_-_CSS_Escape_And_Strictly_Validate_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_Style_Property_Values>`_.

.. _URL Context:

URL Context and Escaping
========================

URLs require multiple types of escaping. This typically involves URL-escaping
in addition to either HTML-escaping or JavaScript-escaping.

There are many special characters that are meaningful in a URL. For example,
both ``&`` and ``=`` are used to designate parts of the query string. If data
is being provided as a query parameter, and it might contain special
characters, it must be fully URL-escaped. This is especially true with user
provided data, which can contain any character. Using the JavaScript URL-
escaping functions as an example, you would use the ``encodeURIComponent``
function on the data which will URL-escape all special characters. Here is an
example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var url = "http://test.com/?data=" + encodeURIComponent(userData)

URL-escaping is susceptible to double-escaping, meaning you must URL-escape its
parts exactly once. It is best to perform the URL-escaping at the time the URL
is being assembled.

Additionally, you will typically HTML-escape or JavaScript-escape a URL
following the same rules for any other data added to the page, since a
properly URL-escaped URL might still contain characters that are meaningful in
an HTML context, such as ``&`` and ``'``.

For example, when a URL is added to the ``href`` attribute of an anchor tag
(``<a>``), it should already be properly URL-escaped, and in addition needs to
be HTML-escaped at the time it is added to the HTML. When you see ``&``
between query parameters as an ``&amp;`` in your HTML page source, you can
rest easy.

.. note:: If the entire URL is user provided, additional validation is required.

When an entire URL (rather that only some query parameters) is user provided,
you must also validate the URL to make sure it uses a whitelisted or
acceptable protocol, such as https. Doing so prevents users from being able to
supply a URL that uses the "javascript" protocol as an example.

For more information, see `OWASP: URL Escape <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#RULE_.235_-_URL_Escape_Before_Inserting_Untrusted_Data_into_HTML_URL_Parameter_Values>`_.


Editing Template Files
**********************

When you edit template files (including Mako templates, Underscore templates,
or JavaScript), use the appropriate conventions.

The topics that follow address these points for each type of file.

#. What has to be at the top of the file (if anything) to make it safe?

#. How is code properly escaped? The answer is different depending on the
   templating language and the context.

#. How do you properly handle internationalization and escaping together? For
   more information, see :ref:`i18n`.

.. note:: Remember to take into account the type of file in addition to the
   programming language involved. For example, JavaScript embedded in an HTML
   Mako template is treated differently than JavaScript in a pure .js file.

To find the proper guidelines to follow, first start with the appropriate file
type below.

.. _Safe Django Template Files:

Django Template Files
=====================

.. highlight:: django

Django templates are considered "safe by default", meaning that expressions
are HTML-escaped by default. HTML-escaping is not always the right choice for
escaping, for example, with embedded JavaScript.

If you need to do special escaping for internationalization or a JavaScript
context in a Django template, you will need to follow the patterns detailed in
:ref:`Safe Mako Template Files`, but we don't currently offer documented helper
functions or syntax for Django templates.


.. _Safe Mako Template Calls:

Mako Template() Calls in Python Files
=====================================

.. highlight:: mako

If a Mako template is loaded from Python outside of the general template loading
scheme, the following default filters should be provided to make the template
safe by default (i.e. use HTML-escaping by default).

.. code-block:: mako

    template = Template(" ... ",
        default_filters=['decode.utf8', 'h'],
    )


.. _Safe Mako Template Files:

Mako Template Files
===================

This topic covers the best practices for protecting Mako template files from
XSS vulnerabilities.

To convert a legacy Mako template to be safe by default, it is recommended
that you complete the following steps.

#. Read through the subtopics in this section and become familiar with the
   current best practices.

#. Follow the step-by-step instructions detailed in :ref:`Making Mako
   Templates Safe By Default`, which will often refer back to this section.

.. _HTML-Escape Mako by Default:

HTML-Escape by Default in Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. highlight:: mako

For Mako templates, all expressions use HTML-escaping by default. This is
accomplished by adding the following directive to the very top of each
template. ::

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>

Using this default HTML-escaping, the following combination represents an
HTML-escaped expression. ::

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    ${data}


.. note:: Mako templates can only have a single ``<%page>`` tag. If there is
   already a ``<%page>`` used for args, you must combine the two.


If you need to disable the default filters, you must use the ``n`` filter as
the first filter. This can be seen in some of the examples below.

For a more in depth understanding of ``n`` filters, see :ref:`n Filter`.

Determining the Context in Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of the Mako template files are in an HTML context. That is why
HTML-escaping is a good default option.

A JavaScript context is often setup implicitly through the use of the
``<%static:require_module>`` tag. In our legacy code, you might also see
explicit ``<script>`` or ``<script type="text/javascript">`` tags that
initiate a JavaScript context. There are some exceptions where a ``<script>``
tag uses a different ``type`` that should be treated as an HTML context rather
than a JavaScript context, for example, in ``<script type="text/template">``.

Also, make sure you follow the best practices for :ref:`URL Context` when
working with URLs, and :ref:`CSS Context` when in the context of a ``<style>``
tag or style attribute.

.. _HTML Context in Mako:

HTML Context in Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most Mako expressions in an HTML context will already be properly HTML-escaped.
See :ref:`HTML-Escape Mako by Default`.

The default HTML-escaping is all that is required, even when passing JSON to a
data attribute that might later be read by JavaScript. See the following
example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    <div
        data-course-name='${course.name}'
        data-course-options='${json.dumps(course.options)}'
    ></div>

For translations that contain no HTML tags, the default HTML-escaping is
enough. You must only import and use ``ugettext`` as shown in the following
simple example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    <%!
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
    %>
    ...
    ${_("Course Outline")}

For more complicated examples of translations that mix plain text and HTML,
use the ``HTML()``, ``Text()``, and ``format()`` functions. Use the ``HTML()``
function when you have a replacement string that contains HTML tags. For the
``HTML()`` function to work, you must first use the ``Text()`` function to
wrap the plain text translated string. Both the ``HTML()`` and ``Text()``
functions must be closed before any calls to ``format()``. You will not use
the ``Text`` function where you don't need the ``HTML()`` function. See the
following example for how to import and use these functions.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    <%!
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

    from openedx.core.djangolib.markup import HTML, Text
    %>
    ...
    ${Text(_("Click over to {link_start}the home page{link_end}.")).format(
        link_start=HTML('<a href="/home">'),
        link_end=HTML('</a>'),
    )}

For a deeper understanding of why you must use ``Text()`` when using ``HTML()``,
see :ref:`Why Text() with HTML()`.

For more details about translating strings and ensuring proper escaping, see
:ref:`i18n`.

There are times where a block of HTML is retrieved using a function in a Mako
expression, such as in the following example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    from openedx.core.djangolib.markup import HTML
    ...
    ${HTML(get_course_date_summary(course, user))}

In this example, you use the ``HTML()`` function to declare the results of the
function as HTML and turn off the default HTML-escaping. Using the ``HTML()``
function by itself can be very dangerous, unless you make sure that the
function returning the HTML has itself properly escaped any plain text.


.. _JavaScript Context in Mako:

JavaScript Context in Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a general guideline, JavaScript in Mako templates should be kept to an
absolute minimum for a number of reasons.

* It is very difficult to mix syntax appropriately, which can lead to bugs,
  some of which might lead to security issues.

* The JavaScript code cannot easily be tested.

* The JavaScript code does not get included for code coverage.

For new code, the only JavaScript code in Mako that is appropriate is the
minimal RequireJS code used to glue the server side and client side code. Often
this is done with factory setup code to pass data to the client.

Special Mako filters are required for working with Mako expressions inside a
JavaScript context.

When you need to dump JSON in the context of JavaScript, you must use either the
``js_escaped_string`` or ``dump_js_escaped_json`` filters.

With ``js_escaped_string`` you must supply the enclosing quotes. When ``None``
is supplied to ``js_escaped_string``, it results in an empty string for
convenience.

Often, the JavaScript context is set up implicitly through the use of
``<%static:require_module>``. In our legacy code, you might also see explicit
``<script>`` or ``<script type="text/javascript">`` tags initiating a
JavaScript context.

Here is an example of how to import and use ``js_escaped_string`` and
``dump_js_escaped_json`` in the context of JavaScript in a Mako template.

.. code-block:: none

    <%namespace name='static' file='static_content.html'/>
    <%!
    from openedx.core.djangolib.js_utils import (
        dump_js_escaped_json, js_escaped_string
    )
    %>
    ...
    <%static:require_module module_name="js/course_factory" class_name="CourseFactory">
        CourseFactory({
            course_name: '${course.name | n, js_escaped_string}',
            course_options: ${course.options | n, dump_js_escaped_json},
            course_max_students: ${course.max_students | n, dump_js_escaped_json},
            course_is_great: ${course.is_great | n, dump_js_escaped_json},
        });
    </%static:require_module>

If you have a string that already contains JSON rather than a Python object,
see :ref:`Strings with JSON` for how to resolve this situation.

In general, the JavaScript code inside a Mako template file should be
succinct, simply providing a bridge to a JavaScript file. For legacy code with
more complicated JavaScript code, you should additionally follow the best
practices documented for :ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.


URL Context in Mako
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To properly URL-escape in Python, you can use `the urllib package
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html#utility-functions>`_.

For more details about URLs, see :ref:`URL Context`.


Mako Defs
~~~~~~~~~

In a Mako ``%def`` we encounter one of the rare cases where we need to turn off
default HTML-escaping using ``| n, decode.utf8``. In the example below, this is
done because the expression assumes that the required JavaScript-escaping was
already performed by the caller.

Be extremely careful when you use ``| n, decode.utf8``, and make sure the
originating code is properly escaped. Note that the ``n`` filter turns off all
default filters, including the default ``decode.utf8`` filter, so it is added
back explicitly. Here is an example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    <%def name="require_module(module_name, class_name)">
        <script type="text/javascript">
            ...
            ${caller.body() | n, decode.utf8}
            ...
        </script>
    </%def>

For more information, see `Mako: Defs and Blocks <http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/defs.html>`_.


.. _Safe JavaScript Files:

JavaScript Files
================

.. highlight:: javascript

JavaScript files are often used to perform DOM manipulation, and must properly
HTML-escape text before inserting it into the DOM.

The `UI Toolkit <https://github.com/edx/edx-ui-toolkit>`_ introduces various
``StringUtils`` and ``HtmlUtils`` that are useful for handling escaping in
JavaScript. You can declare ``StringUtils`` and ``HtmlUtils`` as dependencies
using RequireJS ``define``, as seen in the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    define(['backbone',
            'underscore',
            'gettext',
            'edx-ui-toolkit/js/utils/string-utils',
            'edx-ui-toolkit/js/utils/html-utils'],
        function (Backbone, _, gettext, StringUtils, HtmlUtils) {
            ...

If you are working with code that does not use RequireJS, then this approach
will not be possible. In this situation you can access these functions from
the global ``edx`` namespace instead. For more information, see
:ref:`JavaScript edx Namespace`.

The following ``HtmlUtils`` functions all make use of ``HtmlUtils.HtmlSnippet``.
An HTML snippet is used to communicate to other functions that the string it
represents contains HTML that has been safely escaped as necessary.

The ``HtmlUtils.ensureHtml()`` function will ensure you have properly escaped
HTML by HTML-escaping any plain text string, or simply returning any HTML
snippet provided to it.

If you must perform string interpolation and translation, and your string does
not contain any HTML, then use the plain text ``StringUtils.interpolate()``
function as follows. This function will not escape, and follows the best
practice of delaying escaping as late as possible. Since the result is a plain
text string, it would properly be treated as unescaped text by any of the
``HtmlUtils`` functions.

.. code-block:: javascript

    StringUtils.interpolate(
        gettext('You are enrolling in {courseName}'),
        {
            courseName: 'Rock & Roll 101'
        }
    );

If you are performing string interpolation and translation with a mix of plain
text and HTML, then you must perform HTML-escaping early and the result can be
represented by an HTML snippet. Use the ``HtmlUtils.HTML()`` function to wrap
any string that is already HTML and must not be HTML-escaped. The function
``HtmlUtils.interpolateHtml()`` will perform the interpolations and will
HTML-escape any plain text and not HTML-escape anything wrapped with
``HtmlUtils.HTML()``. See the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    HtmlUtils.interpolateHtml(
        gettext('You are enrolling in {spanStart}{courseName}{spanEnd}'),
        {
            courseName: 'Rock & Roll 101',
            spanStart: HtmlUtils.HTML('<span class="course-title">'),
            spanEnd: HtmlUtils.HTML('</span>')
        }
    );

You can also use ``HtmlUtils.joinHtml()`` to join together a mix of HTML
snippets and plain text strings into a larger HTML snippet where each part will
be properly HTML-escaped as necessary. See the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    HtmlUtils.joinHtml(
        HtmlUtils.HTML('<p>'),
        gettext('This is the best course.'),
        HtmlUtils.HTML('</p>')
    )

Often, much of the preparation of HTML in JavaScript can be written using an
Underscore.js template. The function ``HtmlUtils.template()`` provides
some enhancements for escaping. First, it makes ``HtmlUtils`` available inside
the template automatically. Also, it returns an HTML snippet so that other
``HtmlUtils`` functions know not to HTML-escape its results. It is assumed that
any HTML-escaping required will take place inside the Underscore.js template.
Follow the best practices detailed in :ref:`Safe Underscorejs Template Files`.

The final step of DOM manipulation in JavaScript often happens using JQuery.
There are some JQuery functions such as ``$.text()``, ``$.attr()`` and ``$.val()``
that expect plain text strings and take care of HTML-escaping its input for you.

There are other JQuery functions such as ``$.html()``, ``$.append()`` and
``$.prepend()`` that expect HTML and add it into the DOM. However, these
functions do not know whether or not they are being provided properly escaped
HTML as represented by an HTML snippet.

If you are working with a Backbone.js element, as represented by ``el`` or
``$el``, you can use the JQuery methods directly, as in the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    this.parentElement.append(this.$el);

However, if you are creating the element through one of the other ``HtmlUtils``
functions, you must use ``HtmlUtils.setHtml()``, ``HtmlUtils.append()`` and
``HtmlUtils.prepend()`` in place of the JQuery equivalents. These ``HtmlUtils``
JQuery wrappers respect HTML snippets, and can be used as seen in the following
example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    HtmlUtils.setHtml(
        this.$el,
        HtmlUtils.joinHtml(
            HtmlUtils.HTML('<p>'),
            gettext('This is the best course.'),
            HtmlUtils.HTML('</p>')
        )
    );

In the case of Backbone.js models, although attributes can be retrieved using
the ``get()`` or ``escape()`` functions, you should avoid using the
``escape()`` function, which will HTML-escape the retrieved value. It is
preferable to use the ``get()`` function and delay escaping until the time of
rendering, which is often handled using an Underscore.js template.

To properly URL-escape, you can use the `JavaScript functions
<http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_global.asp>`_ ``encodeURI`` and
``encodeURIComponent``. The following example shows how to properly URL-escape
user provided data before it is used as a query parameter.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var url = "http://test.com/?data=" + encodeURIComponent(userData)

For more information about URLs, see :ref:`URL Context`.

.. _JavaScript edx Namespace:

JavaScript ``edx`` Namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working with code that does not use RequireJS, then it is not
possible to import the ``StringUtils`` and ``HtmlUtils`` functions in
the regular way. In this situation you can access these functions instead
from the global ``edx`` namespace, as follows:

.. code-block:: javascript

    edx.StringUtils.interpolate(...);
    edx.HtmlUtils.setHtml(...);

.. _Safe CoffeeScript Files:

CoffeeScript Files
==================

.. highlight:: coffeescript

For CoffeeScript files, follow the same guidelines as provided for
:ref:`JavaScript files <Safe JavaScript Files>`, but using the CoffeeScript
syntax.


.. _Safe Underscorejs Template Files:

Underscore.js Template Files
============================

.. highlight:: javascript

The best way to HTML-escape expressions in an Underscore.js template is to use
the ``<%-`` tag, which will perform the HTML-escaping.

There are some exceptions where you must use a combination of ``<%=``, which
does not escape, and one of the UI Toolkit ``HtmlUtils`` functions. One
example is when you use the ``HtmlUtils.interpolateHtml()`` function to
translate strings that consist of a mix of plain text and HTML. You can easily
gain access to the ``HtmlUtils`` object inside a template by rendering the
Underscore.js template using the ``HtmlUtils.template()`` function.

If you need to pass an HTML snippet to a template, which has already been
HTML-escaped, you should name the variable with an ``Html`` suffix, and use
``HtmlUtils.ensureHtml()`` to ensure that it was in fact properly HTML-
escaped. See the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    <%= HtmlUtils.ensureHtml(nameHtml) %>

For more details about using the ``HtmlUtils`` utility functions, see
:ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.


.. _Making Mako Templates Safe By Default:

Making Legacy Mako Templates Safe by Default
********************************************

.. highlight:: mako

This topic provides a step-by-step set of instructions for making our Mako
templates safe by default. For best practices to use when you write a new Mako
template, see :ref:`Safe Mako Template Files`.

By default, our Mako templates perform no escaping for expressions. We refer
to this as not being "safe by default". Our intention is get to the state
where our Mako templates *are* "safe by default", by ensuring that Mako
template expressions perform HTML-escaping by default.

.. note:: It is important to understand that HTML-escaping might not be the
   right thing to do in all cases, but it is a good starting place. Additional
   escaping filters are available to help with other scenarios.

Due to valid exceptions to the general rule of HTML-escaping, it is not
possible to configure escaping for all Mako templates in the entire platform
without introducing errors.

The current process is for developers to make changes to each Mako template to
ensure that all expressions use HTML-escaping by default. For details, see
:ref:`Set HTML Escaping Filter as Default`.

The following topics describe the steps you need to take to make your Mako
templates safe by default. Although we have attempted to cover as many
scenarios as possible, we are sure to have missed some cases. If you are
unsure about what to do, reach out and ask for help. For contact information,
see the `Getting Help <https://open.edx.org/getting-help>`_ page on the Open
edX portal .

.. note:: If you come across an old template that is no longer in use and can
   be cleaned out of the platform, help to remove the template rather than
   following these steps.

.. _Set HTML Escaping Filter as Default:

Set HTML-Escaping Filter as Default
===================================

Start by adding the following line to the very top of your Mako template.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>

It is important to understand that this change will affect all expressions in
your Mako template. Although HTML-escaping is a reasonable default, it might
cause issues for certain expressions, including HTML that cannot be escaped.

Also, be careful not to have multiple ``<%page>`` tags in a Mako template.


Run the Safe Template Linter
============================

After setting HTML-escaping by default for the Mako template, run the Safe
Template Linter with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/safe_template_linter.py

Accuracy and completeness of the linter are not guaranteed, so test your work
after fixing all violations.

For more detailed instructions on using the linter, see :ref:`Safe Template
Linter`.

Fix Downstream JavaScript and Underscore.js Templates
=====================================================

Because Mako templates only generate the initial page source, you should
ensure that any downstream JavaScript files or Underscore.js templates also
follow the best practices.

When you have found the proper downstream JavaScript and Underscore.js template
files, you can again run the :ref:`Safe Template Linter` on these files.

For help navigating our client side code, see
`Navigating JavaScript and Underscore.js Templates <https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/x/9QHqAw>`_


.. _Safe Template Linter:

Safe Template Linter
********************

The safe template linter is a tool to help you make sure that you are
following best practices inside edx-platform. It is not yet possible to run the
linter against other repositories.

To run the linter on the changes in your current Git branch, use the following
command.

.. code-block:: bash

    paver run_safecommit_report

To run the linter on the entire edx-platform repository, use the following
command.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/safe_template_linter.py

You can also lint an individual file or recursively lint a directory. Here is an
example of how to lint a single file.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/safe_template_linter.py cms/templates/base.html

For additional options that you can use to run the linter, use the following
command.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./scripts/safe_template_linter.py --help

The following code block shows sample output from the linter.

.. code-block:: bash

    lms/templates/courseware/courseware-error.html: 17:7: mako-wrap-html:       ${_('There has been an error on the {platform_name} servers').format(
    lms/templates/courseware/courseware-error.html: 18:1:                           platform_name=u'<span class="edx">{}</span>'.format(settings.PLATFORM_NAME)
    lms/templates/courseware/courseware-error.html: 19:1:                       )}

Each line of linter output has the following parts.

#. The path of the file containing the violation.

#. The line number and column, for example ``17:7`` above, where the
   violation begins. In the case of Mako expressions, this will be the start
   of the entire expression.

#. A violation ID such as ``mako-wrap-html`` that represents the particular type
   of violation. This only appears on the first line of the violation.
   Additional lines may appear for context only. For more details on individual
   violations, run the linter with ``--help``, or see :ref:`Linter Violations`.

#. The full line of code found at the provided line number.

This linter is relatively new, so if you see excessive false positives, such as
a directory that should possibly be skipped, please provide feedback. The same
is true if you spot an issue that was not caught by the linter. You can reach us
using the `Getting Help <https://open.edx.org/getting-help>`_ page on the Open
edX portal.

.. _Disabling Linter Violations:

Disabling Violations
====================

If you need to disable a violation, add the following disable pragma to a
comment at the start of the line before the violation, or at the end of the
first line of the violation. Use the comment syntax appropriate to the file you
are editing.

Here is example syntax for a Mako template.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## safe-lint: disable=mako-invalid-js-filter,mako-js-string-missing-quotes

Here is example syntax for an Underscore.js template.

.. code-block:: javascript

    <% // safe-lint: disable=underscore-not-escaped %>

.. _Linter Violations:

Linter Violations
=================

The following topics explain the meaning of each violation ID and what you must
do to resolve each violation.

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:

javascript-concat-html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not use ``+`` concatenation on strings that contain HTML. Instead, use
``HtmlUtils.interpolateHtml()`` or ``HtmlUtils.joinHtml()``. For more details on
proper use of ``HtmlUtils``, see :ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.

javascript-escape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Avoid calls to ``escape()``, especially in Backbone.js. Instead, use the
Backbone.js model ``get()`` function, and perform the escaping in the template.
You can also use ``HtmlUtils`` functions, or JQuery's ``text()`` function for
proper escaping. For more details, see :ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.

javascript-interpolate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For interpolation in JavaScript, use ``StringUtils.interpolate()`` or
``HtmlUtils.interpolateHtml()`` as appropriate. For more details, see
:ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.

.. _javascript-jquery-append:

javascript-jquery-append
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not use JQuery's ``append()`` with an argument that might contain unsafe
HTML. The linter allows a limited number of ways of coding with ``append()``
that it considers safe. Each of these safe techniques are detailed below.

Here is some example code with a violation.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Do NOT do this
    self.$el.append(
        _.template(teamActionsTemplate)({message: message})
    );

One way to make this code safe is by replacing the ``append()`` call with a call
to ``HtmlUtils.append()``, as seen in this example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // DO this
    HtmlUtils.append(
        self.$el,
        HtmlUtils.template(teamActionsTemplate)({message: message})
    );

Another way to make this code safe is to continue to use JQuery's ``append()``,
but to pass as an argument to ``append()`` the result of calling ``toString()``
on any ``HtmlUtils`` call, as in the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // DO this
    self.$el.append(
        HtmlUtils.template(teamActionsTemplate)({message: message}).toString()
    );

You can also use JQuery ``append()`` with variables that represent an element,
as designated by starting with a ``$`` or ending in ``El``, such as ``$element``
or ``sampleEl``. You can also use the ``$el`` element from Backbone.js.

Here is an example with one of the above mentioned safe variables.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // DO this
    self.$el.append($button);

For more details regarding ``HtmlUtils``, see :ref:`Safe JavaScript Files`.

javascript-jquery-html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, JQuery's ``html()`` function is used with a string that does not
contain any HTML tags.  If this is the case, just use JQuery`s ``text()``
function instead. Otherwise, you can replace the ``html()`` call with a call to
``HtmlUtils.setHtml()``, or you can call ``toString()`` on any ``HtmlUtils``
function inside the ``html()`` call.

For more detailed examples, see :ref:`javascript-jquery-append`.

javascript-jquery-insert-into-target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JQuery DOM insertion calls that take a target, for example ``appendTo()``, can
only be called from element variables. For example, you could use
``$el.appendTo()``, but you cannot use ``anyOldVariable.appendTo()``.

Alternatively, you could refactor to use a different JQuery method, including
alternatives available in ``HtmlUtils``.

For more details on legal names for element variables, see
:ref:`javascript-jquery-append`.

javascript-jquery-insertion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JQuery DOM insertion calls that take content and do not have an ``HtmlUtils``
equivalent, for example ``before()``, must use other ``HtmlUtils`` calls to be
safe. One option is to refactor your code to use ``HtmlUtils.append()``,
``HtmlUtils.prepend()``, or ``HtmlUtils.setHtml()``. Another alternative is to
use ``toString()`` whenever you use an ``HtmlUtils`` call.

For example, let us look at the following JQuery ``before()`` call that is
considered unsafe.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // Do NOT do this
    this.button.after(message);

Instead, you could refactor the above code to create ``message`` using
``HtmlUtils``, and then complete the refactor using ``HtmlUtils.ensureHtml()``,
as seen in the following example.

.. code-block:: javascript

    // DO this
    messageHtml = HtmlUtils.template(messageTemplate)({message: message});
    this.button.after(
        HtmlUtils.ensureHtml(messageHtml).toString()
    );

javascript-jquery-prepend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not use JQuery's ``prepend()`` with an argument that might contain unsafe HTML.
The linter allows a limited number of ways of coding with ``prepend()`` that it
considers safe. For details of these safe techniques, see those described for
:ref:`javascript-jquery-append`.

mako-html-entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a Mako template is marked safe by default, HTML entities such as ``&amp;``
should instead be plain text such as ``&`` because they will be escaped with the
rest of the expression. If the entity appears in the midst of HTML, it should
probably be wrapped with a call to ``HTML()``.

Here is a violation as an example.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## Do NOT do this
    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    ${_("Details &amp; Schedule")}

Here is the corrected code.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## DO this
    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    ${_("Details & Schedule")}

mako-invalid-html-filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only valid alternative to the default HTML filter when a template is marked
safe by default, is to disable HTML-escaping in one of the following ways.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## DO this sparingly
    ${HTML(x)}
    ## or
    ${x | n, decode.utf8}

.. important:: Use these functions only in the rare cases where you already have
   properly escaped safe HTML, and you cannot move the HTML generation to the
   template.

If you must disable HTML-escaping, of the two alternatives above, using
``HTML()`` is preferred, unless the context is ambiguous and ``HTML()`` does not
make sense, such as in certain Mako defs.

mako-invalid-js-filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a limited set of filters that the linter considers safe in a JavaScript
context, so you must use one of the following safe filters.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%!
    from openedx.core.djangolib.js_utils import dump_js_escaped_json
    %>
    ...
    ${x | n, dump_js_escaped_json}

    ## or
    <%!
    from openedx.core.djangolib.js_utils import js_escaped_string
    %>
    ...
    ${x | n, js_escaped_string}

    ## or DO this sparingly
    ${x | n, decode.utf8}

.. important:: Only in the rare case where you already have properly
   JavaScript-escaped safe HTML, and you cannot move the JavaScript to a
   JavaScript file or Underscore.js template, can you use the filter
   ``| n, decode.utf8``.  This filter turns off all escaping.

Take note of any expression that was mistakenly using ``| h`` in a JavaScript
context. Since the data inside the expression, ``x`` in the above example, will
no longer be HTML-escaped in Mako when you remove the ``| h`` filter, pay extra
attention to ensuring that HTML-escaping is being performed in the downstream
JavaScript.

For help using these filters, see :ref:`JavaScript Context in Mako`.

mako-js-html-string
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not embed Mako expressions directly into a JavaScript string that uses HTML.
JavaScript in a Mako template should be just enough to pass variables from Mako
to JavaScript. Anything more complicated is likely to cause escaping issues.

Here is a sample violation.

.. code-block:: mako

    // Do NOT do this
    var invalid = '<strong>${x | n, js_escaped_string}</strong>'

Instead, simplify the data passing from Mako to JavaScript as follows.

.. code-block:: mako

    // DO this
    var valid = '${x | n, js_escaped_string}'

You can then use the above ``valid`` variable using any of the JavaScript
``HtmlUtils`` functions, or in an Underscore.js template.

mako-js-missing-quotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Mako expression using the ``js_escaped_string`` filter must be wrapped in
quotes.

.. code-block:: mako

    // Do NOT do this
    var message = ${msg | n, js_escaped_string}

    // DO this
    var message = '${msg | n, js_escaped_string}'

mako-missing-default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mako template is missing the directive that makes it safe by default. Add
the following to the top of the Mako template file.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>

It is important to understand that this will add HTML-escaping to all
Mako expressions in the template. The linter may report additional problems once
this has been done, so you will want to run it again after this is in place.

mako-multiple-page-tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Mako template can only have one ``<%page>`` tag. If the template already uses
this tag to pass arguments and you mistakenly add a second ``<%page>`` tag to
make the template safe by default, you must combine these two tags to resolve
the violation.

The following example violates this rule.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## Do NOT do this
    <%page expression_filter="h" />
    ...
    <%page args="section_data" />

Here is the corrected code.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## DO this
    <%page args="section_data" expression_filter="h" />

mako-unknown-context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linter could not determine if the context is JavaScript or HTML. In addition
to using the disable pragma detailed in :ref:`Disabling Linter Violations`,
please report the issue through the `Getting Help
<https://open.edx.org/getting-help>`_ page on the Open edX portal.

mako-unparseable-expression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This violation likely means that there is a syntax error in the Mako template.
If the template is valid, in addition to using the disable pragma detailed in
:ref:`Disabling Linter Violations`, please report the issue through the `Getting
Help <https://open.edx.org/getting-help>`_ page on the Open edX portal.

mako-unwanted-html-filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the page level directive has been added to make the Mako template safe by
default, any use of the ``h`` filter in an expression is redundant. These ``h``
filters should be removed.

python-close-before-format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must close any call to ``Text()`` or ``HTML()`` before calling ``format()``.
Another way to state this is that you should only pass a single literal string
to ``Text()`` or ``HTML()``.

Here is an example of this violation. Note that the problem is subtle, and
that there is only a single ``)`` before the call to ``format()``, closing
the ``_()`` call, but not the ``Text()`` call.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## Do NOT do this
    ${Text(_("Click over to {link_start}the home page{link_end}.").format(
        link_start=HTML('<a href="/home">'),
        link_end=HTML('</a>'),
    ))}

Here is a corrected version of the same code block.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## DO this
    ${Text(_("Click over to {link_start}the home page{link_end}.")).format(
        link_start=HTML('<a href="/home">'),
        link_end=HTML('</a>'),
    )}

.. _python-concat-html:

python-concat-html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is safer to use the ``HTML()`` and ``Text()`` functions, rather than
concatenating strings with HTML. An even better solution would be to handle
interpolation with HTML in a proper template, like a Mako template.

Take the following violation as an example.

.. code-block:: python

    # Do NOT do this
    msg = '<html>' + msg + '</html>'

Instead, it is possible to properly HTML-escape ``msg`` as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    # DO this
    msg = HTML('<html>{msg}</html>').format(msg=msg)

python-custom-escape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of writing a custom escaping method that replaces ``<`` with ``&lt;``,
use a standard escaping function like ``markupsafe.escape()``.

python-deprecated-display-name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The XBlock function ``display_name_with_default_escaped`` has been deprecated
and should not be used. Instead, you must use the call
``display_name_with_default`` and follow the best practices for proper
escaping based on the context.

It might be that ``display_name_with_default_escaped`` was called from Python
while setting up the context for your Mako template. You still must fix this
to be ``display_name_with_default`` and make sure it is properly escaped in
the Mako template.

Take note of any places where this value was used in a JavaScript context. You
must make sure that this data is properly escaped downstream when it is
finally added to the page, for example, in an Underscore.js template.

python-interpolate-html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interpolation with HTML should use the ``HTML()``, ``Text()``, and ``format()``
functions. For details, see :ref:`python-concat-html`.

python-parse-error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This violation likely means that there is a syntax error in the Python file. If
the Python file is valid, in addition to using the disable pragma detailed in
:ref:`Disabling Linter Violations`, please report the issue through the `Getting
Help <https://open.edx.org/getting-help>`_ page on the Open edX portal.

python-requires-html-or-text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python, when using either ``HTML()`` or ``Text()`` for interpolation with the
``format()`` function, you must wrap the initial string with ``HTML()`` or
``Text()`` as appropriate.

In a Mako expression, any interpolation using ``format()`` with interpolated
``HTML()`` calls must be preceded by a call to ``Text()``. An expression with
interpolation typically does not begin with ``HTML()`` because in a template,
any HTML will be either interpolated in or moved out of the expression and into
the outer template HTML.

The following is an example Mako violation.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## Do NOT do this
    ${_("Click over to {link_start}the home page{link_end}.").format(
        link_start=HTML('<a href="/home">'),
        link_end=HTML('</a>'),
    )}

Instead, use ``Text()``, as in the following example.

.. code-block:: mako

    ## DO this
    ${Text(_("Click over to {link_start}the home page{link_end}.")).format(
        link_start=HTML('<a href="/home">'),
        link_end=HTML('</a>'),
    )}

For a deeper understanding of why the function ``Text()`` is required in the
above example, see :ref:`Why Text() with HTML()`.

python-wrap-html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When interpolating a string containing HTML using a call to ``format()``, you
must wrap the HTML with ``HTML()``. You might see this issue in a Mako template
or a Python file. Also, you might have HTML embedded into a larger string that
first needs to be interpolated in. Or, you might already be interpolating in
smaller strings containing HTML, but they simply are not yet protected by a call
to ``HTML()``.

For proper use of ``HTML()`` and ``Text()``, see :ref:`HTML Context in Mako`.

underscore-not-escaped
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Underscore.js template expressions should all be HTML-escaped using
``<%- expression %>``. The only exceptions where you can use ``<%=`` which does
not escape is when making an ``HtmlUtils`` call.

For more details, see :ref:`Safe Underscorejs Template Files`.

Advanced Topics
***************

The following advanced topics cover rare cases and provide a more in-depth
explanation of some methods you can use to prevent cross site scripting
vulnerabilities.

.. contents::
   :depth: 1
   :local:


Why Use Both ``js_escaped_string`` and ``dump_js_escaped_json``?
==================================================================

To escape strings in Mako templates, why must we use ``dump_js_escaped_json``
in addition to using ``js_escaped_string``?

* The ``js_escaped_string`` function provides the additional benefit of
  returning an empty string in the case of None.
* The ``js_escaped_string`` and wrapping quotes makes the expected type more
  declarative.

.. _n Filter:

Mako Filter Ordering and the ``n`` Filter
=========================================

Mako executes any default filter before it executes filters that are added
inside an expression. One such default filter is the ``decode.utf8`` filter,
which is used to decode to UTF-8, but only if the Python object is not already
unicode.

Take the following example Mako expression.

.. code-block:: mako

    ${data | h}

When Mako compiles this expression to Python, it is translated to the
following Python code.

.. code-block:: python

    __M_writer(filters.html_escape(filters.decode.utf8(data)))

From the Python line above, you can see that the default ``decode.utf8`` filter
is applied before the the ``h`` filter, which was supplied inside the
expression.

The ``n`` filter can be used to turn off all default filters, including the
``decode.utf8`` filter. Here is an example Mako expression.

.. code-block:: mako

    ${data | n}

In this case, when Mako compiles this expression to Python, the following
Python code is the result.

.. code-block:: python

    __M_writer(data)

For more information, see `Mako: Expression Filtering <http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/filtering.html>`_.


Mako Blocks
===========

A Mako ``%block`` can sometimes create tricky situations where the context is
not clear. In these cases, it would be best to provide the context (for
example, HTML or JavaScript) in the name of the block.

Take the following Mako ``%block`` definition as an example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    <%block name="html_title">${display_name}</%block>

Based on the above ``%block`` definition, only the name of the block tells us
that it is HTML-escaped, and it is only usable in an HTML context. You could
not use this same ``%block`` in a JavaScript context.

Here is this same ``%block`` above, as it is actually used to display the title.

.. code-block:: mako

    <title>
        <%block name="html_title"></%block>
    </title>

For more information, see `Mako: Defs and Blocks <http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/defs.html>`_.


.. _Strings with JSON:

Strings Containing JSON in Mako
===============================

In the same way that we wait as long as possible to escape, once we know the
context, we also recommend waiting as long as possible before converting from
Python to JSON. Mako templates are often the place where the Python object
should finally be dumped to JSON.

If you find yourself with a string that already contains JSON inside a Mako
template, and you need to use it in a JavaScript context, you have the following
two options.

* Where appropriate, you could attempt to refactor the code to move the call
  to ``json.dumps`` from the Python file feeding the Mako template, into the
  Mako template, replacing that call with ``dump_js_escaped_json``.

* You can call ``json.loads`` before dumping it to ensure it is parseable, as
  in the following example.

.. code-block:: mako

    <script>
        var options = ${json.loads(options_json_string) | n, dump_js_escaped_json};
    </script>


.. _Why Text() with HTML():

Why Do I Need Text() with HTML()?
=================================

You might wonder why the ``Text()`` function is required in Mako templates to
make the ``HTML()`` function work.

The magic behind the ``Text()`` and ``HTML()`` functions is a library called
``markupsafe`` and its ``Markup`` class, which designates that a string is
HTML markup and no longer needs to be HTML-escaped. The difference between
``Text()`` and ``HTML()`` is that ``Text()`` HTML-escapes before it becomes
``Markup``, where ``HTML()`` simply marks a string as ``Markup``.

The magic of ``Markup`` is that any string that is formatted into it is HTML-
escaped during that process. Note how the ``&`` is HTML-escaped in the
following example.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from markupsafe import Markup
    >>> Markup('<div>{}</div>').format('Rock & Roll')
    Markup(u'<div>Rock &amp; Roll</div>')

For the next example, when ``Markup`` is formatted into a ``Markup`` object,
it understands that it should not be HTML-escaped and thus the ``&`` will
remain unchanged.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> Markup('<div>{}</div>').format(Markup('Rock & Roll'))
    Markup(u'<div>Rock & Roll</div>')

A problem arises when we use format on a plain string. Since a string does not
know anything about ``Markup``, the result of this is a plain string again,
rather than a ``Markup`` object. Thus, the result has lost its ``Markup``
magic.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> '<div>{}</div>'.format(Markup('Rock & Roll'))
    '<div>Rock & Roll</div>'

In Mako, we add page-level HTML-escaping by default, which also uses the
``markupsafe`` library. Mako expressions will therefore respect ``Markup``
objects and will not double escape.

.. code-block:: mako

    <%page expression_filter="h"/>
    ...
    ${data}

Therefore, the problem with using ``HTML()`` without the initial ``Text()`` is
that the ``Markup`` object becomes a plain old string and it ends up getting
HTML-escaped, when your intention was to keep the HTML from being HTML-escaped.
