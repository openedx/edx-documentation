EdX Enterprise API Reference
################################

This API reference includes detailed information about the endpoints of the edX
Enterprise API, including the request, response data, and examples. You can use
any technology to send REST API requests as HTTP messages to the edX API. The
example API requests shown in this reference use the ``curl`` command-line program
to show the syntax and data for a request in a way that is easy to read.

*********
Endpoints

include the ``Accept: application/json`` header in your API request. For
example, to request JSON-formatted information about a course run using
``curl``, send a request similar to the following command.

::

   curl -X GET \
   https://api.edx.org/enterprise/v2/enterprise-catalogs/3f56a21c-76c8-47c0-add8-a99714d40d94/courses/MyUni+Sport101x \
