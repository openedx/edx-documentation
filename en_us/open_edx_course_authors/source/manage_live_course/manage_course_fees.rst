Manage Course Fees
#################################

If your course has a fee, you can manage the fees for your course in the
**E-Commerce** section of the Instructor Dashboard. You can set the price for
each seat in the course, create and manage coupon codes and enrollment codes,
and download reports about financial transactions.

Before you can manage your course fees, you must configure your Open edX
environment to support paid courses.

For more information, see the following sections.

.. _Obtain CyberSource Merchant Account:

================================================
Obtain a Merchant Account with CyberSource
================================================

Currently, Open edX only supports payment through CyberSource. To allow
users to submit payment for your course, you must obtain a merchant account
with CyberSource. For more information, see `the CyberSource website
<http://www.cybersource.com/>`_.

When you obtain a merchant account with CyberSource, CyberSource provides you
with the following information. You will add this information to one of the
.json files in your Open edX environment.

* An access key.
* A profile ID.
* A purchase endpoint URL.
* A secret key.


.. _Add Configuration Code:

========================
Add Configuration Code
========================

To enable users to pay for your course, you must add the following
configuration code in your Open edX environment.

* Add the following code to the lms.env.json file.

  .. code-block:: json

    ...
    "FEATURES": {
    ...
    "ENABLE_SHOPPING_CART": true,
    "ENABLE_PAID_COURSE_REGISTRATION": true,
    ...
    }
    ....

* Add the following code to the lms.auth.json file.

  .. code-block:: json

    ...
        "CC_PROCESSOR": {
            "CyberSource2": {
                "ACCESS_KEY": "{access key provided by CyberSource}",
                "PROFILE_ID": "{profile ID provided by CyberSource}",
                "PURCHASE_ENDPOINT": "{purchase endpoint URL provided by CyberSource}",
                "SECRET_KEY": "{secret key provided by CyberSource}"
            }
        },
        "CC_PROCESSOR_NAME": "CyberSource2",
    ...

.. _Add Course Mode:

=============================
Add a Course Mode in Django
=============================

To manage course fees, you must add a mode for the course in the Django
administration website for your Open edX instance.

#. Make sure that you have "superuser" rights on your Open edX production
   stack. For more information, see `Managing the Full Stack
   <https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Managing-the-Full-Stack>`_.
#. Access the Django administration website for your instance of Open edX. To
   do this, go to ``https://<host name of your Open edX instance>/admin`` and
   sign in. For example, this might be ``https://edge.edx.org/admin``.
#. On the **Django Administration** page, select **Course Modes** in the
   **Site Administration** list.
#. In the upper right corner of the page, select **Add course mode**.
#. On the **Add course mode** page, complete the form.

 * **Course id**: Enter the course ID for this course in the
   ``{org}/{course}/{run}`` format. This ID must exactly match the course ID
   that you set in Studio. For example, the course ID may be
   ``edX/DemoX/2015_T2``.
 * **Mode slug**: Set this to ``honor``.
 * **Mode display name**: Enter the mode name that you want learners to see.
   For example, you could enter "Honor Code".
 * **Min price**: Enter the price of a single seat in the course.
 * **Currency**: Leave the default value (``usd``) or enter the ISO code for
   another currency, such as ``sar`` for Saudi Riyal.
 * **Expiration Date and Time**: (optional) The expiration date for the
   course. EdX recommends that you leave these fields blank.
 * **Description**: (optional) A description of the course.
 * **SKU**: (optional) A SKU number for the course.

6. At the bottom of the page, select **Save**.

.. _Assign Admin Roles:

========================
Assign Admin Roles
========================

Two new roles are required for courses that charge fees and that create and
manage coupon codes and enrollment codes.

* The *Finance Admin* role creates and manages discounts and enrollment codes.
  This role also cancels and resubmits invoices.
* The *Sales Admin* role creates and manages coupon codes and enrollment
  codes, but cannot cancel or resubmit invoices.

To add the Finance Admin or Sales Admin role to a user, follow these steps.

.. note:: A user can have both the Finance Admin and Sales Admin roles.

#. Access the Django administration website for your instance of Open edX. To
   do this, go to ``https://<host name of your Open edX instance>/admin`` and
   sign in. For example, this might be ``https://edge.edx.org/admin``.

   If you have problems signing in this way, you can also sign in to your edX
   instance from ``https://<host name of your Open edX instance>/``. After you
   sign in to edX, add ``admin`` after your Open edX instance host name in
   your browser's address bar. Make sure to include a slash (``/``) between
   the host name and the word "admin".

#. On the **Django Administration** page, locate **Student** in the
   **Site Administration** list, and then select **Course access roles**.
#. In the upper right corner of the page, select **Add course access role**.
#. On the **Add course access role** page, complete the form.

 * **User**: The username of the user who needs the Sales Admin or Finance
   Admin role.
 * **Course id**: Enter the course ID for this course in the
   ``{org}/{course}/{run}`` format. This ID must exactly match the course ID
   that you set in Studio. For example, the course ID may be
   ``edX/DemoX/2015_T2``.
 * **Role**: Select **finance_admin** or **sales_admin**.

To add another role for the user, repeat steps 3-4.

When a user has the Sales Admin or Finance Admin role, that user can see an
**E-Commerce** page on the Instructor Dashboard. The **E-Commerce** page
includes the following sections. The Finance Admin role can see all sections.
The Sales Admin role can see all sections except the **Course Seat Purchases**
section.

.. _Create and Manage Enrollment Codes:

******************************************
Create and Manage Enrollment Codes
******************************************

If an organization wants to purchase enrollment for multiple seats in your
course at one time, you can create enrollment codes for the organization. The
purchasing organization then distributes these codes to its learners. Each
enrollment code has an associated URL that learners use to enroll in the
course directly. Learners do not have to pay any additional fees.

Unlike coupon codes, which are valid for multiple learners, each enrollment
code is valid for only one learner.

.. _Create Enrollment Codes:

========================
Create Enrollment Codes
========================

You create enrollment codes on the **E-Commerce** page on the Instructor
Dashboard. To see the **E-Commerce** page, you must have either the Sales Admin
or Finance Admin role. For information, see :ref:`Assign Admin Roles`.

#. On the Instructor Dashboard, select the **E-Commerce** page.
#. In the **Enrollment Codes** section, select **Create Enrollment Codes**.
#. When the **Create Enrollment Codes** form opens, complete the form. The
   following fields are required.

   * Organization name
   * Organization contact
   * Organization contact email
   * Organization billing address
   * Invoice recipient
   * Number of seats
   * Price per seat

#. At the bottom of the form, select **Create Enrollment Codes**.

When you select **Create Enrollment Codes**, the system automatically creates a
comma-separated values (.csv) file and downloads the .csv file to your
computer. In addition to information about your course and the transaction,
such as the invoice number, the .csv file contains course enrollment codes and
URLs. Each enrollment code has a separate URL, and only one learner can use
each enrollment code.

The system also sends a confirmation email to the purchasing organization. The
email instructs the purchasing organization to distribute enrollment codes to
learners and includes a template that the organization can use. The email has
two attachments: an invoice and a .csv file. The .csv file contains only the
enrollment codes and their associated URLs. It does not contain additional
information about your course or the transaction.

Change the Default Email
**************************

When you create enrollment codes, the system automatically sends a
confirmation email message to the purchasing organization. You can change the
default confirmation message according to your organization.

To change the default email, follow these steps.

#. In your Open edX repository, go to the **edx-
   platform/lms/templates/emails** folder.

#. In a text editor, open the following three files.

   * **registration_codes_sale_email.txt**: The confirmation email to send to
     the purchasing organization. This email can include a sample message that
     the purchasing organization can use to distribute enrollment codes to
     individual learners.
   * **registration_codes_sale_invoice_attachment.txt**: The invoice for the
     purchasing organization. The invoice can include payment instructions.
   * **order_confirmation_email.txt**: The confirmation email to send to the
     purchasing organization.
