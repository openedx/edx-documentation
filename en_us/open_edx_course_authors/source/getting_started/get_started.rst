Running an edX Course* guide.

***************
What is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses.

You use Studio to create a course structure, and then add problems, videos, and
other resources for learners.

With Studio, you can also manage the course schedule, identify members of the
course team, set the grading policy, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional
software.

When you log in to Studio, you see the following page, which is your **My

  .. note::
    Enter new course information carefully. This information becomes part of
    the URL for your course. Because this information becomes part of your
    course URL, the total number of characters in the following three fields
    must be 65 or fewer.

  * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name
    may be "Sets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the
    course title.

  * For **Organization**, enter the name of your institution. Do not include
    whitespace or special characters.

  * For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For
    example, for public health course number 207, enter **PH207**. For math
    course 101x, enter **Math101x**. Do not include whitespace or special
    characters in the course number.

#. Select **Save.**

Your new course opens to the **Course Outline** page. Because no content has
been added, this page is empty.

In your browser's address bar, notice that the URL of your course includes the
course organization, number, and course run.

The other sections of this guide describe how you now build and run your
course.
