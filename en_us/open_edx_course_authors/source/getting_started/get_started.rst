What is Studio?
***************

Studio is the edX tool you use to build your courses. 

You use Studio to create course content, problems, videos, and other resources for students.

With Studio, you can also manage your schedule and course team, set grading policies, publish your course, and more.

You use Studio directly through your browser. You do not need any additional software.

When you receive notice that you can create courses, log in to Studio.

You see the following page, which is your **My Courses** dashboard:

  .. note::  
    Enter new course information carefully. This information becomes part of
    the URL for your course. Because this information becomes part of your
    course URL, the total number of characters in the following three fields
    must be 65 or fewer.

  * For **Course Name**, enter the title of your course. For example, the name
    may be “Sets, Maps and Symmetry Groups". Use title capitalization for the
    course title.

  * For **Organization**, enter the name of your institution. Do not include
    whitespace or special characters.

  * For **Course Number**, enter both a subject abbreviation and a number. For
    example, for public health course number 207, enter **PH207**. For math
    course 101x, enter **Math101x**. Do not include whitespace or special
    characters in the course number.

3. Click **Save.**

Your new course opens to the **Course Outline** page. Because you haven't
created any content yet, this page is empty.

In your browser’s address bar, notice that the URL of your course includes the
course organization, number, and course run.

The rest of this documentation describes how you now build and run your course.
