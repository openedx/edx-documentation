Setting Up a Course
################################

When you begin to set up a course, the first step is to plan and specify two
types of basic information about your course.

* **Course** information remains true whether the course runs one time or
  multiple times. This is information such as the course title and number,
  subject, and course description.
* **Course run** information changes every time the course runs. This is
  information such as the course staff and start and end dates.

This section provides information about how to determine required course and
course run information, as well as how to enter this information in Studio.
