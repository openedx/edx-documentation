Using Open edX as an LTI Tool Provider
######################################

Your installation of Open edX can be configured to be a learning tool
interoperability (LTI) provider to other systems and applications. If your Open
edX site is configured to be an LTI provider, you can present content from an
Open edX course in any application that is configured to be a consumer of that
content. As a result, you can reuse Open edX course content, including advanced
problem types and videos, in contexts other than the Open edX LMS. Examples
include courses running on Canvas, Blackboard, and other learning management
systems and applications.

For more information about the configuration process for this feature, see
`Configuring an edX Instance as an LTI Tool Provider`_ in the *Installing,
Configuring, and Running the Open edX Platform* guide.

You use the topics in this section to prepare your course for reuse.
