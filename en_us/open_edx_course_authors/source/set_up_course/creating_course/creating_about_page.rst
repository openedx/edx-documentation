Creating a Course About Page
############################

The course About page, sometimes called the course summary page, provides
information about your course to learners. In addition to the course
:ref:`start and end dates<Scheduling Your Course>` and an overview of course
objectives, the About page can include information such as a course
description with course prerequisites, requirements, and team biographies.
Learners can see the About page before they enroll in the course, and
might decide to enroll based on the content of the page.

You enter the information for the About page in Studio. For more information,
see :ref:`Adding Information to the Course About Page`.

.. note::
  If the CourseTalk widget is enabled for your instance of the Open edX
  platform, the About page for every course also includes the CourseTalk
  widget. Learners who have enrolled in your course use this widget to write
  reviews of your course on the **Home** page in the LMS. These reviews are
  then visible on the course About page. For more information, see
  :ref:`installation:Add CourseTalk`.
