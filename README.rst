Supplying Information with a Pull Request
============================================

The edX documentation team created a `template`_ for pull request descriptions
that you are encouraged to use. You can find it on the team wiki.

======================
Testing a Contribution
======================

Before submitting a pull request, it is recommended you run the test suite on
your contribution to ensure it can be compiled into HTML format without errors.

To run a test compilation of a contribution, first install the prerequisites.

.. code::

  pip install -r shared/travis_requirements.txt

Then run the tests.

.. code::

  ./run_tests.sh

Additionally, you can run tests for a single project. For example, to build an
HTML version of the *Installing, Configuring, and Running the Open edX
Platform* guide, you run this test.

.. code::

  ./run_tests.sh en_us/install_operations/

A convenience script is provided to help you develop new documentation. To use
it you must first install the optional tools, and then run the script.

.. code::

  pip install -r shared/tools.txt
  ./develop.sh en_us/install_operations/

It will output a line of text that looks like this.

  Serving on http://127.0.0.1:9090

You can copy this URL into a web browser to see the HTML output for your
project.

The command starts an HTTP server that renders the HTML for the project. This
HTTP server also monitors the project and detects any changes. When you save a
change to a file, the server rebuilds the HTML and refreshes your browser
automatically. In this way you can rapidly see how changes you make will be
rendered as HTML.
